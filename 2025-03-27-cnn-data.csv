CNN,"Vances set to make a scaled-back, but more political trip to Greenland"," Only days after second lady Usha Vance’s trip to Greenland was announced, out are the dogs and mushers. In is a visit to a US military installation miles away from any civilian population center – with her husband, Vice President JD Vance, tagging along and expected to take aim at the island’s Danish government, according to a senior White House official. What the White House initially characterized as a visit by the second lady to learn more about the culture of the island, which President Donald Trump openly talks about annexing, quickly became contentious – with the leader of the semiautonomous Danish territory Múte Egede describing it as“highly aggressive.” As JD Vance watched the outrage over his wife’s trip grow, he decided to join her,  the senior White House official told CNN. “It was a combination of a little bit of commotion from Danish leaders combined with Vance wanting to go for a while,” said the official, who added that the vice president argued that if Danish and island leaders were going to get “worked up” over his wife’s visit, they could get worked up over him, and his entourage, traveling to the territory. “I decided I didn’t want her to have all that fun by herself and so I’m going to join her,” Vance said in a video announcing his participation earlier this week. Vance’s 11th-hour decision elevates the US delegation visit, with the vice president becoming the highest-ranking US official to visit Greenland, and in so doing, traveling further north than any senior American leader has ever gone on an official visit, the White House official said. But the shortened trip also carries a more overtly militaristic tenor and keeps the American visitors sequestered away from any planned protests. The Vances, who are leaving early Friday and returning late that night, will visit the US Space Force outpost at Pituffik, on the northwest coast of Greenland 1,000 miles from the capital of Nuuk, forgoing Usha Vance’s original plans and any semblance of a cultural exchange. The vice president is expected to receive a private briefing regarding how the Space Force has helped boost US national security interests and speak to the press. Vance’s first trip abroad – to conferences in Paris and Germany – was notable for his tough rhetoric about Europe, a viewpoint reinforced by his texts revealed this week in a private Signal chat about military action in Yemen. His message on this second trip overseas is expected to strike a similar tone. “Unfortunately, Danish leaders have spent decades mistreating the Greenlandic people, treating them like second class citizens and allowing infrastructure on the island to fall into disrepair. Expect the Vice President to emphasize these points as well,” the senior White House official said. The stop at the base highlights some of the rationale behind the Trump administration’s ambitions for Greenland: its strategic importance in the frozen upper latitudes, where competition with Russia and China is fierce. And the visit to the American military base high above the Arctic Circle will largely avoid any potentially embarrassing incidents between the Vances and either members of the public or government officials, many of whom openly spoke out against Usha Vance’s original plans. Protests had been planned in the capital Nuuk, where about a third of Greenlanders live, and Greenland’s second largest city Sisimiut, where a dog sled race is taking place. “Trump’s talk of annexation and the visit of the Vances has united Greenlanders in defiance, with Greenlanders rallying together to protest,” Dwayne Ryan Menezes, director of the UK-based think tank Polar Research and Policy Initiative, told CNN in an email. “The Vances clearly realised that if they visited Nuuk or Sisimiut, the strategy would backfire even more than it has: it would be a PR disaster, as all footage would likely feature protestors with placards of the sort we saw earlier this month (Yankee Go Home, and Make America Go Away), and would expose to the US electorate the misinformation they were fed about how enthusiastically Greenlanders wished for Greenland to join the US,” he said. The White House official pushed back on that assertion, telling CNN, “The itinerary changes had nothing to do with any potential protests.” The official argued that Usha Vance’s original plans were scrapped because her itinerary was not compatible with her husband’s schedule. Her visit to Nuuk, for example, was off the table because Greenland is still forming its government after recent elections and does not have the officials in place to receive him, the White House official said. Meanwhile, the dogsledding race was in a remote part of Greenland, and installing the vice president’s full security footprint wasn’t possible on just a few days’ notice, they added. But the change in plans also appeared to remove the possibility of an overt diplomatic spat between the US and Denmark, whose leaders said they hadn’t offered any official invitation to Usha Vance and pointed out the island is in the middle of a delicate political season as it tries to form its new administration. A new coalition is expected to be announced Friday. “There needs to be a space in which politicians can negotiate to form a government,” said Ulrik Pram Gad, senior researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies. “And if you, as a foreign power, impose yourself on that process, that is felt as aggression.” Gad added that Vance going to Pituffik Space Base “from a Greenlandic perspective, is a lot less aggressive, because that’s a place where Greenlanders are used to American officials. It’s far away from anyone Greenlandic, basically.” Usha Vance has largely remained above the political fray since her husband took office, assembling a small team of staff, transitioning her three children to life at the Naval Observatory, and settling into the public role, for which she will have her own platform and responsibilities. Her original visit to Greenland for the dogsled race appeared to originate with an invitation from American Daybreak, a group founded by Tom Dans, who worked on Arctic issues in the first Trump administration. “As a sponsor and supporter of this event I encouraged and invited the Second Lady and other senior Administration officials to attend this monumental race. This visit was always intended to be purely personal in nature and in the spirit of the friendship between our two nations,” Dans wrote on X, describing himself as “very disappointed by the negative and hostile reaction” to the visit. Organizers for the race said they didn’t invite Usha Vance specifically, but that anyone could attend. But residents in Sisimiut planned to silently demonstrate her visit by turning their backs to her motorcade, according to Greenlandic newspaper Sermitsiaq. “In general, I think most Greenlanders are relieved that the unofficial visit to Sisimiut and Nuuk was cancelled. Personally, I think it is a big win for Greenland,” said Jakob Nordstrøm, who runs a local pilot business in Nuuk. “Most Greenlanders welcome tourists from the United States, but obviously this was not a tourist visit,” Nordstrøm said. American officials have downplayed the role potential protests played in altering plans for the trip. One person close to JD Vance said he had wanted to go to the island since Donald Trump Jr. returned from a visit earlier this year and “raved about how cool it was.” “Vice President JD Vance and Second Lady Usha Vance are proud to visit the Pituffik Space Base in Greenland this Friday,” said Taylor Van Kirk, Vance’s press secretary. “As the Vice President has said, previous US leaders have neglected Arctic security, while Greenland’s Danish rulers have neglected their security obligations to the island. The security of Greenland is critical in ensuring the security of the rest of the world, and the Vice President looks forward to learning more about the island.” The US Consulate in Nuuk declined to comment, referring questions to the vice president’s office. Also set to join the delegation are national security adviser Mike Waltz – who has been at the center of this week’s scandal over top Trump Cabinet officialsdiscussing strikes in Yemen in a Signalchain that included a reporter – and Energy Secretary Chris Wright, as well as Republican Sen. Mike Lee, a vocal supporter of Trump’s desire to control Greenland. White House officials have argued for months that the president’s fixation with acquiring Greenland has dual benefits, both economic and for national security. The territory holds vast stores of rare earth minerals critical for high-tech industries, but the White House also believes that American control would help curb Russian and Chinese aggression in the Artic region. Trump has ratcheted up his rhetoric in recent months, insisting his administration will acquire the territory despite Greenland and Denmark’s leaders repeatedly making clear the island isn’t for sale. “We have to have it,” he said on the “VINCE” podcast earlier this week. “And I think we will have it.” CNN’s Lauren Kent contributed to this story."
CNN,Trump admin temporarily restores funding to initiative tracking Russian war crimes," The Trump administration has temporarily restored funding to an initiative that tracks alleged Russian war crimes after cutting its assistance, according to a congressional source familiar with the matter. Funding for the Ukraine Conflict Observatory has been restored for six weeks, the source told CNN. This will allow the repository of evidence on the alleged Russian war crimes, including the locations of more than 30,000 abducted Ukrainian children, to be sent to the European Union’s law enforcement agency, Europol. CNNreported last weekthe funding had been terminated and that researchers had lost access to the major database of evidence. The State Department said last week it had cut funding to the program “based on the assessments that we’ve been making …what was in America’s interests.” The temporary policy reversal, first reported by theWashington Post, comes after congressional concern about the administration’s decision to end funding to the initiative. The contract supporting the Ukraine Conflict Observatory was among thousands of foreign aid awards that the administration has terminated. Critics have argued that terminations have been done with no clear criteria and little regard for the consequences. “Funding is being provided for a short period while the Conflict Observatory implementers ensure the proper transfer of the critical data on the children to the appropriate authorities,” a State Department spokesperson said in statement Thursday. “It is part of the standard close out procedures for terminated programs.” MITRE, a non-profit organization involved in the Ukraine Conflict Observatory, said in a statement Thursday that they, “the Department of State, and related partners have initiated a plan that enables the data to be moved from the contract partner to the U.S. government.” “While MITRE continues to work in the public interest and remains focused on our federal sponsors’ most critical missions, our efforts related to this important topic will conclude once the data is with the U.S. government,” the statement said. The evidence collected by the Ukraine Conflict Observatory had been used in efforts to prosecute Russian officials for their alleged involvement in war crimes, including the International Criminal Court arrest warrant against Russian President Vladimir Putin. According to a letter from House lawmakers last week, Yale’s Humanitarian Research Lab (HRL) – which had been conducting research for the Ukraine Conflict Observatory – “compiled three reports, sourced from satellite imagery and biometric data, tracking identities and locations of over 30,000 children from Ukraine at dozens of locations.” “This data is absolutely crucial to Ukraine’s efforts to return their children home,” the lawmakers said in the letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The importance of returning “the forcibly transferred Ukrainian children” was a key topic in the meeting between top US and Ukrainian officials in Jeddah earlier this month, according to a joint statement after the meeting. In a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday, President Donald Trump asked “about the children who had gone missing from Ukraine during the war, including the ones that had been abducted,” according to a statement about the call. “President Trump promised to work closely with both parties to help make sure those children were returned home.” Last week’s letter, led by Ohio Democratic Rep. Greg Landsman, noted that the evidence was being preserved “to be shared with Europol and the government of Ukraine to secure their return.” “Yale HRL’s funding has been terminated, and the status of the secure evidence repository is unknown. This vital resource cannot be lost,” it said."
CNN,Top senators ask for watchdog to probe Signal chat as some in GOP say it’s ‘time to move on’," Congressional Republicans are grappling with how to respond to senior Trump administration officials’ use of aSignal group chatto discuss a military strike, with a key Senate committee requesting a watchdog probe of the matter as some in the GOP say there’s no need for further investigation. On Thursday morning, the Senate Armed Services Committee’s Republican chair and top Democrat formally requested an inquiry and assessment by the Pentagon’s acting inspector general into the incident. “This chat was alleged to have included classified information pertaining to sensitive military actions in Yemen. If true, this reporting raises questions as to the use of unclassified networks to discuss sensitive and classified information, as well as the sharing of such information with those who do not have proper clearance and need to know,” GOP Sen. Roger Wicker and Democratic Sen. Jack Reed wrote in a letter. Wicker and Reed had also requested a briefing for the committee. But several GOP senators also on the Armed Services Committee insisted that it’s “time to move on,” arguing that such an incident won’t happen again and that the Trump officials involved in the Signal chat have learned from their mistakes. “It’s time to move on. The facts are not going to change. I don’t know that there are any more that could be revealed,” Sen. Kevin Cramer told reporters Thursday at the Capitol. Cramer has been critical of the Signal chat incident, telling CNN on Tuesday, “this has got to be the last time something this big and dumb happens.” “Signal is an inappropriate platform to discuss highly sensitive information. They did that, and I’m quite confident it’s never going to happen again,” the North Dakota Republican added on Thursday. Some Republicans on the House Armed Services Committee insisted that no congressional investigation is “needed at this time” into the chat, which included Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. “I think that the secretary of defense has done a great job. If he wants to come and brief the committee, I think that’d be helpful. But I don’t see where an investigation is needed at this time,” GOP Rep. Cory Mills of Florida told CNN on Thursday. Senate Republican Leader John Thune did not explicitly call for a stand-alone Senate investigation on Tuesday, but told CNN’s Manu Raju that he anticipates the Senate Armed Services Committee may want those involved to testify before the panel. “I think everybody has acknowledged, including the White House, that yeah, mistakes were made. And what we want to do is make sure that something like that doesn’t happen again,” Thune said. Senate Republicans are working to strike a careful balance over the issue. Some have said that mistakes were made, but have also been cautious not to be too heavy-handed in their criticism or confrontational toward the administration. Speaker Mike Johnson said on Wednesday that the Signal chat was a “mistake” but that the incident has been “overblown” by the media. “It’s been overblown, I think, by the media. I think this is a mistake. It was acknowledged as such. I’m certain it will not happen again. We move forward,” Johnson told reporters at the Capitol on Wednesday. Democrats have been calling for accountability and pushing for an investigation into the incident, which they argue endangered national security and US troops. A number of congressional Democrats have called for Hegseth to resign. Hegseth has said that that there was no classified information discussed in the group chat. ButCNN has reportedthat the information thatHegsethdisclosed in the Signal chat was highly classified at the time he wrote it, especially because the operation had not even started yet, according to a US defense official familiar with the operation and another source who was briefed on it afterward. Republican Sen. Susan Collins, who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, on Thursday said she supports an investigation into the Signal group chat and that she’s still seeking “clarification” from top intelligence officials. “I definitely support an IG investigation on how all of these high-ranking members used a platform that is not appropriate for what they were discussing,” she told reporters, later adding, “Most of all we need to know how someone who should not have been on the call was able to be added to it.” Collins said while Signal messages are encrypted and “safer” than other forms of communication, the use in this case by officials is “still very problematic.” “There are a lot of issues that need follow-up, and I think that the IG is the one to do it.” Later Thursday, Wicker declined to comment to CNN on a timeline for the inspector general investigation or if he’d consider holding open hearings.

CNN,White House pulls Stefanik’s UN ambassador nomination amid concern over narrow Republican House majority," The White House on Thursday pulled Rep. Elise Stefanik’s nomination to be US ambassador to the United Nations amid concerns over slim margins in the US House of Representatives,  keeping one of Trump’s most vocal allies in Congress. President Donald Trumpdeclared he was withdrawing the nomination, which had already languished for months, to help preserve the House GOP’s razor-thin majority – critical, he said, to enacting his agenda. The White House’s sudden decision to pull GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik’s nomination for a Cabinet spot has scrambled plans across Capitol Hill. Speaker Mike Johnson was quick to say that he will find a leadership role for the congresswoman, but it is not yet clear what that will be after the 10-year House veteran had forfeited her hard-fought leadership spot in order to join the administration. Some of the congresswoman’s colleagues had anticipated her departure in the coming weeks. One House GOP leader had planned a farewell toast for Stefanik in the Capitol next week, according to a person familiar with the plans. The decision stunned some members of House GOP leadership, as well as members of the New York delegation, who were deep in conversations about that special election, according to multiple people familiar with the decision. The president said he didn’t want to “take a chance” on Stefanik’s open seat in northern New York, which heavily favored Republicans. “The people love Elise and, with her, we have nothing to worry about come Election Day. There are others that can do a good job at the United Nations. Therefore, Elise will stay in Congress, rejoin the House Leadership Team, and continue to fight for our amazing American People,” the president wrote on his Truth Social platform. It’s a significant turn for Stefanik, who had taken part in at least one Cabinet meeting and had been taking part inevents in her districtthat local media outlets had billed as a “farewell tour.” While she was sworn in for the 119th Congress, she has had bare bones staffing and no major role on any House committees. Multiple House Republicans said they were caught off guard by the decision and noted that Johnson and his leadership team have so far had little difficulty maneuvering tough votes on the floor, according to three people familiar with internal discussions. In a statement, Speaker Mike Johnson thanked Stefanik for agreeing to remain in the House and vowed to create a new place for her on his leadership team. “It is well known Republicans have a razor-thin House majority, and Elise’s agreement to withdraw her nomination will allow us to keep one of the toughest, most resolute members of our Conference in place to help drive forward President Trump’s America First policies,” Johnson wrote. “I will invite her to return to the leadership table immediately.” But it’s not yet clear where she will fit in the House GOP leadership team. Stefanik gave up her post as the No. 3 House Republican to GOP Rep. Lisa McClain, and a source familiar with McClain’s thinking said she is not resigning from her position. Asked about the White House’s decision to pull the nomination because of tight margins in the House, GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski said, “They just realized that now?” Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Jim Risch said earlier Thursday he had been informed that Stefanik’s nomination would be withdrawn by the White House. Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Thursday that Stefanik “would have been a good UN ambassador” but acknowledged the House’s slim margin. “I think there’s some political realities that they’re grappling with in the House right now and every vote counts,” Thune said. Trumpannouncedthat he had chosen Stefanik, a New York congresswoman and longtime ally, as his pick for the Cabinet role days after the November 2024 election. The narrow majority has routinely created headaches for Johnson in bringing bills to the floor and poses a threat to congressional GOP plans to pass a sweeping package focused on tax cuts that could be Trump’s signature legislative achievement – if Republicans can stay unified to pass it without support from Democrats. Currently, Republicans hold 218 seats to Democrats’ 213 and there are four vacancies. Under the current breakdown, Republicans can only afford to have two defections and still pass a bill on a party-line vote. There are two special elections set for Tuesday to fill vacant seats previously held by Republicans, but even after those elections, the GOP House majority will remain narrow. Democrats quickly seized on Trump’s admission that Republicans did not want to take a chance with the New York special election, even if they privately acknowledged that the seat was highly unlikely to flip. “Republicans are running scared. What happened to their so-called mandate?” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries asked in a statement. And the House Democrats’ leadership-aligned super PAC suggested Republicans are nervous about the midterms. “House Republicans are in a full-blown panic over their razor-thin majority, worrying about holding on to a seat that Trump won by 21%. They know they’re screwed in 2026,” Katarina Flicker, spokeswoman for House Majority PAC, wrote in a statement. This headline and story have been updated with additional developments.

CNN,Republicans grow concerned about Trump’s handpicked candidate in Florida special election," Top Republicans grew so concerned about the lackluster performance of their own GOP House candidate in an upcoming special election in Florida that President Donald Trump’s team and members of House GOP leadership decided to personally intervene. A top adviser to Trump reached out directly to state Sen. Randy Fine, with a message that he needed to get his house in order and get on the airwaves, a White House source told CNN. And some Republican leaders were even more blunt. House GOP campaign chief Rep. Richard Hudson and House Majority Whip Tom Emmer each separately told Fine to “get his sh*t together,” according to two GOP sources working closely on the race. Now, weeks later, Republicans are bracing for a closer-than-expected result Tuesday in Florida’s deep-red 6th Congressional District, where their nominee has been significantly outraised and is at risk of falling far short of the president’s November performance in the district. Reflecting that concern, Trump called into a pair of tele-rallies Thursday evening to give a boost to Fine, in addition to the GOP candidate in the Florida’s 1st Congressional District, Jimmy Patronis. “We’re just a few days away from an all-important special election taking place in your state on Tuesday, April 1, and I’m asking you to get out and vote for a true American patriot, somebody that I’ve gotten to know very well, Randy Fine,” Trump said during the tele-rally for Fine. And the president spoke to the escalating scrutiny on the pair of contests during the other event, for Patronis. “The whole country’s actually watching this one. It’s a very big one,” Trump said. Both parties agree that Fine remains poised to win the special election for the 6th District seat, which became vacant when the president tapped former Rep. Mike Waltz to be his national security adviser. Waltz won reelection in November by 33 points. But Democrat Josh Weil, a teacher, has outraised Fine nearly 10-to-1 and run a much more aggressive campaign, tying Fine to the Elon Musk-run Department of Government Efficiency and potential cuts toMedicaidandSocial Security. Hudson, the chair of the House Republicans’ campaign arm, said they had a good candidate in Fine, but acknowledged he could have started airing TV ads sooner. “I’d rather him have gotten up a few weeks earlier, but we’ve got lots of folks on the ground helping turn out the vote, so I’m confident,” Hudson told CNN. Fine, reached by phone, declined to comment about his campaign. Republicans say a win is a win, regardless of the margin. They’ve argued their challenge is a disparity between how motivated — specifically, how angry — voters in the two parties are in the wake of last year’s election. “Republicans are popping champagne from November, and the Democrats are gathering their pitchforks and knives,” said one senior Republican operative close to the campaign in Florida. “The Democrats are very engaged and want to just have any scalp that they can get.” Still, the concern for Republicans — and the hope for Democrats — is that a tighter-than-anticipated finish would be viewed as evidence that Republicans’ agenda in Washington doesn’t come with a voter-backed mandate. Democratic strategists say that if Weil can get within 10-15 points of Fine, it will suggest the party’s base is motivated and voters are souring on Trump’s agenda. “I don’t think that they’re concerned about losing the seat,” Beth Matuga, a Florida-based Democratic strategist, said of Republicans. “I think the concern is that this special election becomes some sort of a bellwether and reinvigorates Democrats in Florida, even in the case of a defeat.” Republicans are also defending an open seat in Florida’s 1st District, where Democrat Gay Valimont is challenging Patronis for the seat formerly held by Rep. Matt Gaetz. Fine, who spent four terms in the state House before being elected to the state Senate in November, has been a polarizing figure in Florida politics. He hascalled for the expulsion of “non-Americans”who have “advocated for Muslim terror” and backed the Parental Rights in Education Act, known as the “Don’t Say Gay” bill by critics. He’s also clashed with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. During the 2024 GOP presidential primary, Fineswitched his endorsementfrom DeSantis to Trump, claiming the Florida governor had done “almost nothing” to address antisemitism. DeSantis dismissed the criticism as “pure politics.” Asked about the race this week, DeSantis took a jab at Fine, predicting that the state senator’s showing on Tuesday would be a “way underperformance” compared to his margin of victory in the 2022 governor’s race or Trump’s in 2024. “They’re going to try to lay that at the feet of President Trump,” DeSantis told reporters this week. “That is not a reflection of President Trump; it’s a reflection of the specific candidate running in that race.” A similar sentiment has been shared on Capitol Hill, where senior House Republicans widely fear that next Tuesday’s race will be closer than it should be but are still confident of victory. For weeks, GOP leaders have grown increasingly frustrated at Fine. They’ve argued that the Florida Republican failed to mount a serious campaign from the start and has been particularly slow at raising money and getting on the airwaves, according to three people familiar with the conversations. “Do people wish Randy had taken this seriously from the get-go? Absolutely. But I haven’t even thought about him losing,” one of those people — a senior GOP operative involved in the race — told CNN. Another senior GOP operative predicted Fine would ultimately win but described his campaign as “a disaster.” Meanwhile, House GOP leaders have worked to temper expectations for next Tuesday’s special within their own jittery conference. At a closed-door meeting on Tuesday, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise cautioned members that it could be a closer-than-expected race, in part because of the lackluster fundraising on the GOP side, and that no one should expect a massive win, according to a person in attendance. Rep. Ron Estes, a Kansas Republican who won his own special election in 2017, also spoke up to offer a political reality check for off-year special elections. Still, the House GOP campaign arm has been mostly hands-off in the race, given its heavily Republican lean. Neither party’s official side has spent money in the race. “Randy Fine will be a Member of Congress,” Maureen O’Toole, a spokesperson for the National Republican Congressional Committee, told CNN. “Everything else is just noise.” Senior House Democrats are also closely monitoring the race, with at least one group conducting polling to gauge their party’s support going into the final week, according to a person familiar with the discussions. But there’s zero expectation among high-level leaders that the race will be close. “If he overperforms by 5, and you apply that to the rest of the battlefield, you win 15 seats,” this person said, while acknowledging that the Democratic candidate, Weil, has his own operational problems — namely high spending on consultants with little money on TV. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries argued Monday that Democrats would overperform in both Florida special elections because voters are rejecting the Republican Party’s agenda, undercutting the idea that Trump has a mandate. Jeffries pointed to other special elections at the local level where Democratic candidates have won a higher share of the vote than Harris did in November. “What I can say, almost guarantee, is that the Democratic candidate in both of these Florida special elections will significantly overperform, which will represent another sign that the Republicans are on the run and that Democrats are going to take back control of the House of Representatives next year,” Jeffries said at a press conference Monday. At the root of Republican concerns has been the strong fundraising by the Democratic candidates. In the 6th District, Weil has outraised Fine by about $9.5 million to about $1 million, and outspent him by about $8.2 million to just $895,000. Fine reported only $93,000 in cash as of March 13 on his pre-election FEC filing, revealing a severely depleted war chest. Weil credited his fundraising success to a focus on protecting Social Security and Medicare and lowering costs. “I’m grateful for the hundreds of thousands of Floridians and regular Americans who still believe in a better future,” he said in a statement to CNN. The two Democrats haven’t received much outside help. The Democratic National Committee has made a small but undisclosed investment in the race, and chairman Ken Martin announced Thursday that he would campaign in the 6th District the weekend before the election. Weil and Valimont have run joint ads seizing on Musk’s elevated profile in the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency, highlighting images of Musk with a chainsaw onstage at a conservative gathering last month as he celebrated steep federal spending cuts. “Elon is shredding our democracy,”one of the digital ads opens. The campaigns have also faced questions about how they raised, and spent, their massive fundraising hauls. Both Democrats have worked with Key Lime Strategies and Media, a consulting firm that takes a 25% cut of the funds it helps raised. Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and DNC vice chair David Hogg both criticized the firm for using their images in fundraising appeals without their consent. Fine’s campaign has also knocked Weil for his spending, including money spent on musicians and entertainers and more than $50,000 on a multi-room Airbnb that doubled as an office and living space for Weil, who does not currently live in the district. Jackson McMillan, the chief executive of Key Lime Strategies and Media and Weil’s finance director, defended his fundraising tactics, noting the company’s fee structure is on its website. “Randy Fine is trying to discredit our fundraising because he’s been caught sleeping at the wheel, running a weak race and now he’s in trouble,” McMillan said in a statement to CNN. Wendy Garcia, Weil’s campaign manager, said in a statement to CNN that the rental home allows multiple members of the campaign to “have a presence” in the district and reduce lodging costs and office space. Fine, meanwhile, has seen an uptick in outside spending on his behalf in the final weeks of the race. Musk’s super PAC made its first foray into the races this week, disclosing Tuesday that it was spending about $20,000 on texting services split equally between support for both Republican candidates. The Republican Jewish Coalition’s political action committee has spent more than $94,000 on the race, according to recent FEC data. Ad spending for the 6th District race has ticked up ahead of Election Day. Advertisers have combined to spend more than $7.7 million on ads, and Republicans have outspent Democrats by about $4.4 million to $3.4 million. In the 1st District race, Democrats lead in ad spending, about $3.2 million to $2.1 million, according to AdImpact. No major outside groups have stepped in to help the two Democrats on the airwaves, but a few GOP groups have targeted the race with seven-figure buys, including Defend American Jobs, funded by several cryptocurrency interests and veteran investors Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, and another group, Conservative Fighters PAC, with more opaque funding. Both groups have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in the closing stretch of the race running TV ads aimed at leveraging Trump’s political influence, alerting voters to his endorsements and in particular looking to give Fine a boost. “Florida voters, President Donald J. Trump has an urgent message: President Trump needs Randy Fine in Congress,”one of the ads says. “Republicans, President Trump needs you on April 1st! Vote Trump endorsed businessman Randy Fine,”says another. This story has been updated with new reporting. CNN’s Manu Raju contributed to this report."
CNN,Judge orders Trump administration to keep Signal records amid Yemen attack chat controversy," A federal judge on Thursday ordered key Trump administration agencies to preserve messages sent on Signal between March 11 to March 15. Judge James Boasberg made the ruling in a preservation lawsuit brought in the wake of the revelation that Cabinet officials were discussing war plans on Signal. The Justice Department says the administration is already working to track down and preserve the Signal texts from that period. Boasberg’s temporary restraining order also directs the administration to file a status report Monday, accompanied with declarations from government officials, explaining the steps the agencies were taking to preserve the messages. The messages in question include exchanges about US military strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen. The Atlantic reported earlier this week that just hours before the March 15 strikes, top members of President Donald Trump’s Cabinetdiscussed detailed operational plansin a Signal group thread. A day after the revelation, a watchdog group filed a lawsuit accusing the Cabinet officials on the chat of violating federal records law. Sources told CNN that the details shared in the group message by US Secretary of DefensePete Hegsethwereclassified, though the Trump administration has denied it. American Oversight, the nonprofit advocacy group that brought the records-preservation lawsuit, said Thursday’s ruling “marks an important step toward accountability.” The group had asked in the lawsuit for the federal courts to force Trump administration officials to do better record-keeping. Related article‘Principled and fair’: Judge Boasberg had nonpartisan record before facing Trump’s fury “The public has a right to know how decisions about war and national security are made — and accountability doesn’t disappear just because a message was set to auto-delete,” the group’s interim executive director, Chioma Chukwu, said in a statement. The judge focused Thursday’s 20-minute court hearing on “finding common ground” between the Trump administration and American Oversight so that he could issue a temporary restraining order to which both sides would be amenable. Prior to the hearing, the Treasury Department said it has already tracked down and preserved a “partial” version of the chat for federal record-keeping purposes. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was part of the March 15 Signal chat, and the text of those messages are now preserved, a department official wrote to the court in a sworn statement. Though he didn’t mention it explicitly, Boasberg is also presiding over the high-profile case challenging Trump’s invocation of a rarely used war power to swiftly deport migrants. The Signal case was assigned to Boasberg by chance, the judge said, acknowledging possible questions from the public, explaining in detail how the random case assignment system works in DC’s federal court. During Thursday’s hearing, Boasberg also slyly referenced a major dispute in the deportation case, around whether the administration was obligated to follow an order he issued verbally from the bench before he put it in writing.

CNN,"Alleged top MS-13 member arrested in Virginia was ‘leader for the East Coast,’ AG Bondi says"," Federal law enforcement officers captured an alleged “major leader” of the MS-13 gang Thursday morning, President Donald Trump said on social media. “Just captured a major leader of MS13,”he wrote. The alleged 24-year-old gang member, was arrested in the early hours of Thursday in Prince William County, Virginia. Attorney General Pam Bondi, who was present for the raid along with FBI Director Kash Patel, said in a news conference that the man was “the leader for the East Coast, one of the top three in the entire country, right here in Virginia, living half an hour outside of Washington, DC.” “He is an illegal alien from El Salvador, and he will not be living in our country much longer,” Bondi said. According to court documents unsealed Thursday afternoon in the Eastern District of Virginia, Henrry Josue Villatoro Santos, a citizen of El Salvador was taken into custody Thursday on an outstanding administrative immigration warrant. He was also charged with illegal possession of a firearm. Federal agents found several firearms in the residence. No attorney was listed for the defendant on the court documents. The arrest was executed by a newinteragency task forceestablished by the Trump administration to target transnational organized crime and coordinate ongoing immigration enforcement efforts across Virginia. Its creation was part of a crackdown by the Trump administration on foreign gang members residing in the United States. While officials did not explicitly say whether the man will be deported, the administration is working to pay El Salvador to imprison immigrants that it said have committed crimes and have been expelled from the US. MS-13 deportations, particularly of leaders, who are a priority for Salvadoran officials, and Trump officials agreed, CNN haspreviously reported. One such effort included the deporting César Humberto López-Larios, CNN reported, an alleged top leader of the MS-13 who US investigators believe has information that could implicate top Salvadoran government officials in possibly corrupt deals with the violent gang. The Justice Department quietly dropped charges against López-Larios and returned him to El Salvador earlier this month."
CNN,Concerns about Hegseth’s judgment come roaring back after group chat scandal," Ever sincenews brokeon Monday that top Trump officials discussed US military attack plans in a group chat that inadvertently included a journalist, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has projected unflinching confidence. “I know exactly what I’m doing,” Hegseth told reporters Tuesday. By Wednesday, however, other defense officials were increasingly skeptical of that, especially after The Atlantic magazinerevealedthe details that Hegseth shared in the Signal chat about the pending strike on Houthi rebels in Yemen, including the timing and types of aircraft. “It is safe to say that anybody in uniform would be court-martialed for this,” a defense official told CNN. “My most junior analysts know not to do this.” National Security Adviser Mike Waltz has been criticized for inviting Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg into the chat. And CIA director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, both of whom were on the Signal chat, were grilled over two days of Congressional testimony. But former national security and intelligence officials say it’s Hegseth who looks particularly bad given the level of detail he shared. “The egregious actor here is Hegseth,” said one former senior intelligence official. “He’s in the bullseye now because he puts all this out on a Signal chat.” Interviews with multiple current and former national security officials this week, including career military and civilian officials, reflect growing concerns about Hegseth’s leadership at the Pentagon. The group chat scandal is the latest in a series of what some officials say are examples of questionable judgment by the former Fox News host, as he has struggled to implement consistent and durable policies across the Defense Department in his first two months as secretary. Georgia GOP Rep. Rich McCormick, a former combat veteran, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer there ""should be accountability"" for the Houthi attack information disclosed in a Signal group chat, but stopped short of calling for any cabinet member to resign. Related videoGOP Rep. calls Signal chat a mistake, says it ‘does jeopardize people’s lives’ So far, several high-profile initiatives spearheaded by Hegseth inside DoD since he was confirmed in January— including several related to the southern border mission and a purge of “DEI” content—have either been scaled back or rescinded as he has rushed to implement changes demanded by President Donald Trump and Elon Musk. The current and former officials said the rocky start underscores both Hegseth’s inexperience and his freewheeling approach to leadership. Many of his orders are verbal and based on gut instinct rather than a deliberative, multi-layered process, people familiar with his methods said. “He’s a TV personality,” one of the sources said. “[A general officer] makes a recommendation, and he’s like, ‘Yeah, yeah, go do it.’ [Former Defense Secretary] Lloyd Austin would never be like, ‘Yeah, yeah, go do it.’ He’d be like, ‘We’ll take it under consideration.’” Several DoD officials told CNN that Hegseth seems more preoccupied with appearances than with substance—wanting to appear more “lethal” than his predecessor and pulling resources from elsewhere in DoD to achieve that image. “Your job is to make sure that it’s lethality, lethality, lethality,” Hegseth told reporters late last year.  “Everything else is gone, everything else that distracts from that shouldn’t be happening.” On Monday, troops armed with M4 assault rifles were seen guarding Hegseth’s plane at Joint Base Andrews. The security posture stood in stark contrast to the agents and service members who typically greeted Austin at the Maryland base, who were usually armed only with concealed handguns. While unusual, a spokesperson for Air Combat Command said the posture “aligns with standing orders for personnel, especially when operating in official capacities such as deployments or movements during missions.” At the southern border, thousands of troops surged there by Hegseth in recent months have primarily been building barricades, putting up concertina wire, and generally “just standing around,” another defense official told CNN. Hegseth also earlier this month ordered the deployment of two heavily armed warships to patrol the waters near the border, where they will primarily be supporting Coast Guard operations to interdict drugs. One of the warships’ most recent deployments was to the Red Sea, where it was tasked with intercepting Houthi missiles and drones. The deployments to the border are “clearly more about optics,” the defense official said. The official added that diverting troops and assets to patrol a mostly peaceful border was actually drawing them away from training exercises that could improve overall combat readiness. As for the Signal chat, Hegseth has insisted that nothing classified was shared over text, but four people familiar with the matter told CNN that the information Hegseth disclosed on the Houthi group chat was classified, despite the administration’s claims to the contrary. One of the people said they saw documents sent within DoD about the operation, which were marked classified and included the same information Hegseth disclosed in the Signal chat about specific weapons platforms and timing. “It was classified when it was shared below the principal level,” this person said. Hegseth could have declassified the information himself, but he has not said that he did. It’s also unclear why information about an imminent or ongoing operation would be declassified before it was successfully completed. The White House, for now, is standing by Hegseth in the wake of the Signal chat scandal. President Trump said his national security adviser Mike Waltz had taken responsibility for creating the Signal group, but the president seemed unaware of the role Hegseth played in including detailed information about airstrikes in the chat. “It was Mike, I guess, I don’t know,” Trump said when questioned about which of his team was behind the chat. Earlier, the White House said a team of officials from the National Security Council and White House counsel’s office were looking into the matter, assisted by billionaire Elon Musk. Yet while Trump said Waltz had assumed responsibility for the error, he shrugged off any culpability on the part of his defense secretary, who sent a timeline of the planned attack before it was underway. “How do you bring Hegseth into it? He had nothing to do with it,” Trump said, sounding surprised a reporter would raise the issue. Earlier, the White House said Trump had looked at Hegseth’s messages that were included in the text chain published by The Atlantic. “It’s all a witch-hunt,” Trump said. The White House on Thursday morning declined to offer an update on its internal investigation into the Signal group chat of top Trump national security officials, calling the episode a “mistake.” Hegseth, who served as an infantry officer in the Army National Guard and deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, was confirmed by a razor-thin margin in January as Democrats and some Republicans pressed him on allegations of sexual misconduct, infidelity and excessive drinking in his past. In his first appearance on the world stage as Defense Secretary, Hegseth told NATO in February that Ukrainian membership in the alliance was off the table — a statement that Republican Sen. Roger Wicker, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, quickly called “a rookie mistake” that took away some of the US’ negotiating leverage in pending ceasefire talks. Hegseth later said he would not be involved in the negotiations over ending the war between Ukraine and Russia. Wicker is now formally asking the administration for an inspector general report on the Signal chat, plus a classified briefing from a senior official. Related articleSources say the details shared by Hegseth in Signal chat were classified as Atlantic publishes additional messages Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune on Wednesday called on Hegseth and other top Trump officials to own their mistakes related to Signal group chat revelations so that they are not repeated. “The important thing here is these guys, they made a mistake, they know it. They should own it and fix it so that never happens again,” Thune said. Asked by CNN if he has confidence in Hegseth, Thune again did not directly answer and pointed to the success of the underlying mission. “The execution of the strike looks like pretty flawless,” he said before again urging the officials to come clean. But the strikes have not appeared to deter the Houthis. On Thursday, the Israeli military has said that sirens sounded in several parts of the country Thursday after two missiles were fired from Yemen. The Houthis took responsibility for the attack. A purge of “diversity” content on Defense Department websites, mandated by Hegseth in a February memo, is being reviewed following outcry over DoD’s hasty removal of historically significant articles and images. A top DoD spokesperson was reassigned over the debacle, and Hegseth’s spokesperson, Sean Parnell, acknowledged last week that mistakes were made. He said DoD is now republishing some of the tens of thousands of pieces of content that were removed. “Of all the things they could be doing, the places they’re putting their focuses on first are really things that just don’t matter … This was literally a waste of our time,” a defense official told CNN of the content purge. “This does absolutely nothing to make us stronger, more lethal, better prepared.” Meanwhile, military deportation flights have slowed to a trickle, because the Department of Homeland Security has not actually needed the large and expensive C-17s to help transport migrants, multiple officials said. Only one military flight per week is taking off on average, holding a handful of migrants. And the US Naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba—which Hegseth in January touted as a “perfect place” to hold as many as 30,000 migrants—is nearly empty. A significant portion of the 900 troops surged there last month to handle an influx of deportees could soon be sent home, officials said. Several of Hegseth’s directives—issued at Trump’s behest—have also hit legal setbacks. A federal judge last week indefinitely blocked DoD’s ban on transgender service members, dealing a major defeat to a controversial policy the president resurrected from his first term. Another federal judge ordered earlier this month that DoD and other federal agencies reinstate probationary employees who were fired at the direction of the Office of Personnel Management. Defense officials warned superiors at the time that such mass firings could be illegal, CNN reported last month. One of the few directives Hegseth has put in writing, a recent strategic guidance memo overhauling the Pentagon’s priorities, appeared to some defense officials like it was more about messaging than substance, amounting to a written pledge by Hegseth to fulfill several of Trump’s favorite military-related promises. The memo, reviewed by CNN, did not have a separate section detailing the threat posted by Russia, for example, but it did include vague directives to ramp up border operations and even develop credible military options related to the Panama Canal. Hegseth ultimately rose to the rank of Major before leaving the National Guard in 2021, and has the least experience of any Senate-confirmed defense secretary in recent history. His immediate predecessor Austin, a four-star general, served for 41 years and commanded US Central Command; former Secretary of Defense Mark Esper served as the Secretary of the Army before being confirmed as SecDef; and former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, also a 40-year veteran and four-star general, commanded US Central Command as well before being confirmed as Trump’s first secretary of defense. The Signal chat fiasco has further highlighted Hegseth’s greenness when it comes to the established protocols for dealing with a highly classified military operation involving airstrikes on a foreign country, a defense official said. “This is all indicative of his utter inexperience,” the official said.

CNN,Trump’s favorite F-word is getting a workout," A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for freehere. “Election fraud. You’ve heard the term,” President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House on Tuesday as he signeda new executive ordermeant to safeguard US elections by requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote in every state. Yes, we have heard the term. Over and over again. But we’re still looking for the proof. Trump won two of the presidential elections in which he was a candidate, but he’s alleged election fraud in all three. A special commission he set up to uncover election fraud during his first presidential term did not uncover any conspiracy or widespread evidence of fraud andwas disbanded. During his second presidential term, Trump isn’t bothering with trying to identify election fraud; he’s simply moving forward with plans to change the system anyway. “Fraud,” nebulous and unprovable, has turned into Trump’s go-to justification not only for modifying election procedures, but also for his larger designs to shrink the federal government. Trump promised during his presidential campaign that Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid benefits would not be touched. But now, he argues that “waste, fraud and abuse”require taking a hard look at those programs. Trump and Elon Musk have both repeatedly argued, by misrepresenting the data in a government database of Social Security numbers, that many millions of very, very old people might befraudulently getting benefits. Never mind that the more appropriate data set suggested a problem a fraction of that size. Musk, writes CNN’s Tami Luhby, is “on the hunt for fraud” at the Social Security Administration. His Department of Government Efficiency unleashed chaos at the agency that provides benefits to 73 million Americans when it announced a new policy to require in-person visits from people who could not verify their identity online. The agency, which like most of the federal government is already reeling from Musk’s efforts to cull the size of the federal workforce, would have been crushed by people showing up at understaffed Social Security Administration Offices. This week, it announced it would delay the policy rollout until April 14 and limit the new requirement to only those filing for retirement, survivors or family benefits. Preventing fraud was also the stated reason for the Social Security Administration clamping down on those trying to change their bank account information over the phone.Read Luhby’s full report. Defending cuts by DOGE, Trump said during his speech to Congress last month that the group, staffed, he said, by “intelligent, mostly young people,” has “found hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud.” That claim of uncovered fraud has been impossible to substantiate since DOGE has worked largely in secret, and the claims of savings made on its website have been repeatedly shown to double-count and miscount the value of cuts. More importantly, neither DOGE nor the White House has documented how cut programs and contracts were fraudulent. They were clearly part of programs the administration disagreed with, but a policy difference is a different thing than fraud, which is a crime. Trump knows this because his company was found guilty ofcriminal tax fraudin 2022 and he was found liable forcivil tax fraudin New York last year. Included in the staff and programming cuts at many agencies have beengovernment watchdogs such as inspectors general, the very stopgaps in place to prevent fraud. This issue is playing out on alarger scale at the IRS, where thousands of workers are facing termination during tax filing season. Musk has pushed a conspiracy theory, which is not supported by any factual evidence, that Democrats are using “entitlements fraud” as a magnet to bring immigrants into the country illegally and turn them into voters. We’vepreviously pointed outthe many holes in that particular theory, but suffice it to say there is no current viable path to citizenship (and therefore voting) for the undocumented. There’s still no evidence of widespread election fraud, despite Trump’s unending claims, but this new executive action, he said, would “end it, hopefully.” The order seeks to add a proof of citizenship requirement to the federal voter registration template used by states. It also seeks to give Musk’s DOGE access to state voter rolls. Expect court battles. Critics argue voting by noncitizens is already illegal and has never been shown to be a major problem. Requiring proof of citizenship, they contend, is a hindrance to poor people and the elderly, who might not have access to a passport or other specific document. Some states already share voter information, but streamlining a national database could violate the Constitution’s guidance that states should run their own elections and run the risk of purging naturalized citizens, in particular. Read more on Trump’s election integrity executive order from CNN’s Tierney Sneed and Ethan Cohen. Even if Trump’s executive order withstands an expected court challenge, and even if there ends up being a new nationwide requirement to provide documentation of citizenship before registering to vote, Trump has created an insert-allegation-of-fraud-here template for future candidates and presidents. You will hear the term “election fraud” again."
CNN,The White House says the Yemen security breach is a hoax. Here’s why it’s not," In Donald Trump’s White House, it matters less what you screw up than how hard you fight back. The uproar over operational details of military strikes on Yemen posted ona group chat among top administration officialsis highlighting this fundamental rule of life in the president’s orbit. Naive and sloppy behavior by top Trump aides could have endangered US pilots. One of the worst intelligence breaches by top officials in years, it raises grave questions about the competence of top officials meant to keep Americans safe. But the administration’s main concern is protecting the president and his team. They are demonizing those who point out their malfeasance and embroidering the wider conspiratorial narrative that Trump is again a victim of adeep state witch hunt. The obsession with answering a national security scandal with a fiercely political argument is characteristic of a White House that never admits wrongdoing — following one of the core principles of Trump’s pre-political life. But the drama may already have damaged US operations in Yemen as well as America’s reputation more broadly and offered an intelligence bonanza to its enemies. The contempt by top officials for basic security precautions and a refusal to hold themselves to account for transgressions that could get a subordinate dismissed or even prosecuted can only compromise the integrity of government. It’s too early to say, however, whether the careers of top Cabinet members and officials are threatened and whether Trump himself might pay a political price. The president’s process of souring on subordinates is often a slow burn, which can be affected by media coverage and where blemishes gather their own momentum and limit the shelf life of top aides. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Wednesday insisted that the affair was a big “hoax” and showed that “Democrats and their propagandists in the mainstream media know how to fabricate, orchestrate and disseminate a misinformation campaign quite well.” She also attacked the integrity of Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg, who was mistakenly added to the chat among senior officials. Trump, meanwhile, claimed that the explicit pre-mission details of attacks on Houthi rebels posted by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth were no big deal, arguing that national security adviser Mike Waltz took responsibility for putting Goldberg into the chat on the Signal app. “How do you bring Hegseth into this?” Trump asked a reporter in the Oval Office. “Hegseth had nothing to do with this.” At the heart of the president’s strategy is a willingness to blatantly deny facts that are obvious to anyone who reads the additional text messaged published by the Atlantic on Wednesday. In a way, this refusal to accept the truth gives the administration a special kind of power, since it suggests there is nothing that it can’t get away with. Democratic lawmakers and media commentators who point out the truth make little headway because they are playing a conventional game that can’t engage with Trump’s shifting of realities. The White House also tried to blur the damning evidence of the controversy with a semantic argument about whether the information posted by Hegsethwas classifiedor amounted to “war plans.” Leavitt tried to pass off specific information on the thread about the timing of US attacks by warplanes and drones as a “policy discussion” and as usual blamed everything on Trump’s predecessor, referring to Iran-backed Houthi militants as terrorists who were “allowed to run wild by the Biden administration.” The Trump strategy of never admitting wrongdoing and going for all-out attack was quickly adopted by Hegseth and Waltz as soon as the story broke. The defense secretary fiercely attacked Goldberg and insisted repeatedly and inaccurately that “no one is texting war plans.” He claimed in a statement that no classified information was posted nor information “about sources and methods.” “We will continue to do our job, while the media does what it does best: peddle hoaxes,” he added. Hegseth’s defiance was typical of the bombast that Trump spotted when he was a Fox News anchor and vehement defender of the president in his first term and that made him defense secretary, despite his lack of high-level national security experience. Waltz also indulged in several of the histrionic television appearances that Trump demands of his subordinates. On Fox News on Tuesday, he called Goldberg a “loser” and launched a new conspiracy that suggested he had somehow hacked his way into the chat. While blasting coverage of their poor operational security and incompetence as a “hoax” – a timeworn tactic to give direction to the conservative media machine – senior Trump officials were ignoring the gravity of their errors. The most obvious danger of the notorious group chat was that it could have put American service personnel at risk during raids over Yemen. Despite his denials, Hegseth posted information on timing, targets and weapons systems before attacks took place, according to details of the chat posted by the Atlantic. “215et: F-18s LAUNCH (1st strike package)” one of the texts read. “1345: ‘Trigger Based’ F-18 1st Strike Window Starts (Target Terrorist is @ his Known Location so SHOULD BE ON TIME – also, Strike Drones Launch (MQ-9s)” another one said. Normal practice in US military operations is to keep intelligence under the tightest hold until all Americans are out of danger. Posting details of forthcoming strikes on a platform that could be intercepted by hostile intelligence agencies and passed on to Houthi units was hugely irresponsible. Related articleThe larger problem uncovered by the Signal scandal In this case, no US pilots or planes were brought down by anti-aircraft fire. But their luck may not hold in the event of a future such lapse. And hostile powers now have an even greater reason to monitor the insecure communications of top officials. “It’s a level of arrogance and incompetence that frankly is terrifying,” Sen. Mark Warner told CNN’s Kasie Hunt on “The Arena.” The top Democrat on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence added: “Why I’m so upset is this puts our guys and gals in harm’s way.” An enemy spy agency might also have used such information to alert targets to escape. Such is the inaccessibility of Yemen that it’s hard to make independent judgments about Trump’s claim that US military operations against Houthis who targeted commercial shipping in the Red Sea are hugely successful. Hegseth’s indiscreet texts also pose serious intelligence risks. He boasted, for instance, that the US had taken out “their top missile guy” and that the US had positive identification of the target walking into his girlfriend’s building, which had collapsed after the US attack. Such knowledge is valuable to surviving Houthi leaders and could lead them to increase their own security. And while Hegseth insisted that there were “no sources and methods” disclosed, Houthi rebels now know the US has great visibility into granular movements in Yemen, either through satellite or airborne surveillance or from intelligence assets. “(Houthis) know that we have probably some human intelligence on the ground watching that apartment,” retired US Army Brigadier General Steven Anderson told Jim Sciutto on CNN International. “That person might very well be being tortured or dead right now as a result of that thread.” The fallout from the Signal chat also threatens to create divides within top national security agencies. While Trump and Hegseth argue that there is nothing wrong in the potential exposure of details of ongoing military operations, it’s unlikely a lower-level official or member of the uniformed military would get leniency for similar behavior. “I assure you, if this had been (a) major and captain and young lieutenants who had been on a chat and revealed a bunch of classified information, they would be prosecuted. They would probably lose their commissions,” said retired Admiral James Stavridis on “CNN News Central.” Hegseth’s credibility is especially in question, and his vow at his confirmation hearing that true leadership was now returning to the US military rings hollow. “Accountability is coming, because everybody in this room knows, if you’re a rifleman and you lose your rifle, they’re throwing the book at you. But if you’re a general who loses a war, you get a promotion,” Hegseth said, at a hearing memorable forwarnings by Democratsthat he lacked the experience for the job. “Everyone from the top, from the most senior general to the most lowly private, (we) will ensure that they’re treated fairly.” While Hegseth is not holding himself accountable, the chances that he or any other officials will face outside discipline or investigations appear slim. The White House has installed Trump ultra-loyalists at the Department of Justice and the FBI – agencies that in a normal administration might investigate such breaches as the Signal thread. Independent watchdog officials known as inspectors generalhave also been firedthroughout the government. And Republican lawmakers have proved loath to submit the Trump administration to serious oversight. For now, Trump is standing behind his officials, including Waltz and Hegseth. To do otherwise would validate political opponents who say he chose aides who were deeply unqualified for their jobs. Leavitt said on Fox News on Tuesday that “President Trump absolutely has the full confidence in his national security team.” But history shows such assurances are worth little. The president backs his officials – until he doesn’t. National security advisers have proven to be especially vulnerable: The president worked his way through four permanent appointees in the post in his first term. In February 2018, for example, then-White House press secretary Sarah Sanders was asked about Trump’s attitude towards his then-national security adviser H.R. McMaster. “He still has confidence in General McMaster,” Sanders said. A month later, McMaster was gone."
CNN,AP photographer testifies on White House’s ban: ‘We’re basically dead in the water on major news stories’," A veteran AP photographer and top White House correspondent testified Thursday that the news organization has struggled to compete in its coverage of the Trump presidency since White House’s decision to limit its access to presidential events, the Oval Office and Air Force One. Evan Vucci, the chief photographer for the AP in Washington, testified during a hearing in his company’s legal challenge to the White House ban that since the organization has had its access severely curtailed, it’s “really struggling to keep up” with its competitors, particularly during major news events that have happened during the opening weeks of President Donald Trump’s second term. Related live-storyTrump’s presidency: Signal scandal, health department cuts and new auto tariffs “It’s hurting us big time,” Vucci said at one point in response to questions from the news organization’s attorney, Charles Tobin. “We’re basically dead in the water on major news stories.” AP’s chief White House correspondent, Zeke Miller, testified Thursday on the impact the limitations have had on the outlet’s work, telling the court the outlet was forced to report in a “delayed fashion” and that its coverage did not have “the same level of completeness.” The AP, one of the world’s biggest news outlets and wire service that’s used by local publications around the world, was singled out by the White House over itsrefusalto substitute “Gulf of America” for “Gulf of Mexico.” The issue was underscored, Vucci said, during thecontentious Oval Office meetinglast month between Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The administration’s decision to ban Washington-based AP photographers and reporters from the Oval Office meant the organization had to rely on one of its foreign-based photographers to capture visuals of the event. But that person, Vucci said, lacked the experience and skill he has that allow him to transmit photos back to his editors for wider distribution within seconds. The foreign-based photographer was able to attend the event as part of the group of reporters covering Zelensky, not Trump specifically. “We just absolutely got slammed in the play,” Vucci said. “We got destroyed.” Vucci said during his testimony that the AP’s photographs reach some 4 billion people globally and stressed that the organization’s absence from certain White House events in recent weeks is meaningful to the public. “Associated Press photographers are the gold standard,” he said. “Of course it matters to the public. … It’s awful.” Pressed by Tobin on what he knows about how the White House is now choosing which photographers can now attend certain White House events, Vucci said he was “clueless.” “There’s no rhyme or reason,” he said. “I don’t think anyone knows.” Under cross-examination by Justice Department attorney Brian Hudak, Vucci struggled to answer specific questions about how the AP was harmed financially by the White House, saying he wasn’t the best person to speak to those details. And later, when US District Judge Trevor McFadden asked if, as an artful photographer, Vucci has changed how he snaps pictures of the president since the ban has been in effect, he pushed back strongly on the idea. “My approach doesn’t change,” he said. “I’m a professional.” Vucci took the famous photograph of Trump raising his fist moments after surviving an assassination attempt during a campaign rally last summer. Asked about the image on Thursday by Tobin and Trump’s own embrace of it, Vucci described it as “an iconic photograph.” Thursday’s hearing is the AP’s latest shot at convincing McFadden to order the administration to restore the outlet’s full access to White House events. The Trump appointee had declined in late February to issue a temporary restraining order that would have done just that. Now, Tobin is pressing the judge to issue a preliminary injunction in his client’s favor. “AP has now spent 44 days in the penalty box,” he told the judge just after the proceedings got underway. Miller testified that he has observed “softening” of the questions asked by other outlets during presidential events since the restrictions were imposed. Miller he said had noticed, in reading transcripts and other coverage of the outlets that are participating in such pool events, that there had generally been a “softening of tone and tenor” in the questions being asked of the president by other journalists in the pool. And since AP reporters must rely on reporting from other journalists for pool events the outlet is locked out of, Miller said it was possible that such a “softening” was impacting his company’s ability to adequately cover the news. “We don’t know what we’re missing out on,” he said. McFadden, who was appointed by Trump, returned to the “softening” claim at the end of Miller’s testimony, asking if there were specific outlets or examples he could point to. Miler did not identify any particular outlet, but said he had noticed that outlets in the pool were asking fewer questions about the “news of the day” – meaning the big stories about the administration at a given time – and that some questions tended to be not on topic or irrelevant. He also recalled noticing in coverage of SpaceX’s recent return of some astronauts that journalists were referring to the Gulf of Mexico as just “the gulf.” Miller said it seemed they were trying to “skirt around the issue.” This story has been updated with additional developments."
CNN,"‘Something stinks’: Elon Musk, congressional Republicans target Democrats’ main fundraising machine"," ActBlue, a fundraising juggernaut for liberal candidates and causes, is facing stepped-up scrutiny and criticism from Republicans on Capitol Hill and allies of President Donald Trump – as the GOP flexes its new power in Washington and targets one of the key pillars of the Democratic Party’s financial infrastructure. Three Republicans in Congress – including the chairmen of the House Oversight and Administration panels – are urging Trump’s Treasury Department to share with lawmakers reports of suspicious financial transactions related to ActBlue. Other GOP lawmakers are demanding probes by Treasury and the FBI into whether the fundraising platform has helped organizations engaged in terrorism or violated federal campaign finance laws. And billionaire Trump donor Elon Musk – who is overseeing the administration’s controversial effort to rapidly shrink the federal government – has criticized ActBlue, seeking to tie it to protests and acts of vandalism against his electric-vehicle company Tesla. He has argued, without evidence to substantiate his claims, that some prominent Democrats – including one who died in 2019 – were funding ActBlue and the protests. Related ARTICLEHow elderly dementia patients are unwittingly fueling political campaigns “Something stinks about ActBlue,” Muskpostedearlier this month on his social media platform, X. Officials with ActBlue deny any wrongdoing. “ActBlue has always dealt with attacks and baseless claims from the Rightthat are designed to undermine the power of the small-dollar donors who rely on our platform,” spokesperson Megan Hughes said in a statement in CNN. “This new, coordinated attack is different only in scale, and our team remains steadfast in defending against these bad-faith attacks.” She said the platform would continue its “mission to expand access to political giving and ensure people-powered movements continue to thrive.” ActBlue, a nonprofit organization, is a fundraising powerhouse for Democrats and progressive groups – helping to funnel small-dollar donations to candidates, party committees and others. In all, it has collected more than $16 billion since its founding in 2004, according to a running tally on its website. Although it has competitors, it has long dominated processing payments online for the party. According to the platform, more than 14 million users have saved their contact and payment information with the group, allowing contributors to easily make one-click donations. But the ramped-up criticism from Republicans comes as ActBlue has faced internal tumult – including the recent departure of several high-level staffers asfirst reportedby The New York Times – and criticism from some Democratic consultants and others in liberal circles over whether the platform is doing enough to protect donors from deceptive tactics. Last December, for instance, dozens of individuals and progressive groups signed an open letter to ActBlue, urging reforms – including prohibiting political committees that raise money on the platform from using misleading language in fundraising solicitations. But some Democrats worry that – with Republicans now controlling all the levers of government in Washington – the increased scrutiny could serve as a precursor to a Republican attempt to shut down the platform entirely and undermine Democratic fundraising in future elections. Josh Nelson, the CEO of the ad platform Civic Shout and one of the signatories of last year’s letter recommending changes to ActBlue’s policies, said his concerns about its internal practices have taken a back seat this year to his growing alarm over what he views as “illegitimate attacks” from the GOP. “I think Republicans know that ActBlue has been an extremely effective fundraising platform for thousands of Democratic campaigns and progressive groups,” Nelson said. “They’re just trying to use power to harm their political opponents in future elections.” “The question is how far will Republicans go?” GOP lawmakers in recent years have increased their scrutiny of ActBlue, questioning how it guards against fraud and prevents foreigners from illegally contributing to US campaigns. Among the issued raised: ActBlue did not always require donors to add the CVV number – or card verification value – on every credit card transaction. (ActBlue has added the CVV requirement but has said it has long used several reliable means to prevent fraud and prohibit illicit foreign contributions, including an address verification system to ensure cardholder addresses match those at the banks that issued the cards. Americans living abroad, for instance, also must include a copy of their passport photo.) But this month has seen a slew of fresh ActBlue activity from GOP lawmakers, who are seeking executive branch probes or access to sensitive documents from Treasury, such as the “suspicious activity reports” or SARs, which financial institutions file with the agency to flag suspected cases of money laundering, fraud or other suspicious transactions. Wisconsin GOP Rep. Bryan Steil, who oversees the House Administration Committee, and others have complained that the Biden administration provided only limited information in response to requests for the reports involving ActBlue. He recently joined House Oversight and Accountability Committee chairman, Kentucky Rep. James Comer, and New York Rep. Nick Langworthy in a letter that seeks all suspicious activity reports mentioning ActBlue filed at any point from January 1, 2023. It’s not clear whether Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will cooperate. Currently, the House Administration Committee “is in communication with the Treasury Department about reviewing SARs,” a source familiar told CNN this week. A Treasury spokesperson did not comment. Other GOP lawmakers pushing for probes of the fundraising platform include Trump allies, California Rep. Darrell Issa and Arizona Rep. Andy Biggs. In the meantime, Democrats are trying to use the GOP scrutiny to bring in more political contributions. “Republicans are attacking ActBlue because small-dollar donations from people like you are a major advantage for Democratic campaigns up-and-down the ballot,” read a recent fundraising email from the Democratic National Committee. The appeal then links users to ActBlue to help Democrats “fight back.”"
CNN,Trump admin has terminated majority of its funding for key Syrian humanitarian organization," The Trump administration has terminated a majority of its funding for a key Syrian civil and humanitarian organization,the White Helmets,according to internal documents and the organization. The funding from the US Agency for International Development (USAID) for the White Helmets’ firefighting, search and rescue, and community resilience work was terminated as part of the administration’s sweeping cancelation of foreign aid contracts. A smaller contract from the US State Department to support accountability work remains active. The move to cut millions of dollars in USAID funding to the White Helmets comes as Syria is in a period of significant transition after the fall of the Assad regime. It is a decision that the organization hopes the US government will reconsider. The White Helmets, also known as Syria Civil Defense, was founded by volunteers in 2013 to respond to the catastrophic impacts of Syria’s civil war. In the years since, they have provided emergency medical services, civilian evacuations, search and rescue missions, and investigative work – often under extremely dangerous circumstances. They were vilified and targeted by the now-ousted Syrian regime and its allies, including Russia, but have long been backed by the United States. Farouq Habib, the deputy general manager of the organization, said they have had a “great partnership” with USAID – the organization’s largest donor – for nearly 10 years, and are very proud of the partnership and the support they’ve received from the American people. “US support during this transitional phase of Syrian history is very important as we pass a new era and we need to continue to fill the vacuum in the absence of a functional, strong government,” he told CNN. The impact of the cut in funding “is devastating,” Habib said, noting that “the needs have dramatically increased.” “After the fall of the Assad regime, the White Helmets expanded from what was previously opposition-controlled areas in North Syria to almost all of Syria. So we used to serve 5 million civilians in the past, now we work for 20 million,” Habib explained. “We’re trying to defer the crisis by reallocating funds from other European donors, but definitely it will not be enough to fund the total budget for the year,” he said. The White Helmets were formally notified that the USAID contract was terminated. However, they are in communication with USAID and are hopeful the termination will be reversed, particularly given the life-saving nature of their work. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has claimed that the administration would not cut funding for life-saving programs. In a letter to Congress, a USAID official said that as of March 21, “a total of 5,341 awards have been terminated.” An accompanying list of foreign assistance awards listed a nearly $30 million contract for the White Helmets as being terminated. A portion money from that contract, which was listed as beginning in February 2023, has already been spent. A separate list of State Department awards showed a $1.4 million contact for the White Helmets as still being active. A State Department spokesperson told CNN that “State Department assistance for the White Helmets in Syria has resumed.” Asked about the termination of the USAID award, the spokesperson said that “after a thorough review of nearly 6,500 operational and programming awards to ensure foreign assistance works to make America safer, stronger, and more prosperous, USAID has terminated more than 5,300 grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements.” “Each award terminated was reviewed individually for alignment with Agency and Administration priorities, and terminations were executed where Secretary Rubio determined the award was inconsistent with the national interest or agency policy priorities,” they said."
CNN,Law firms are scared to speak out amid Trump’s attacks on their livelihood," The fear and loathing among lawyers in Washington, DC, has never been greater. After a series of White House executive orders threatening their business and hiring practices, several powerful Washington law firms face a defining choice: push back publicly in defense of their industry or quietly hope to avoid President Donald Trump’s wrath. Many firms are afraid that if they are targeted by Trump, it could devastate their business if both clients and partners flee, reconfiguringthe centers of powerin Washington’s most influential private industry. Related articleTrump’s assault on elites encompasses almost every aspect of American life “We could see a shakeup like we’ve never seen before,” Ivan Adler, a headhunter for lobbyists who regularly works with Washington’s law firms. “This is the talk of the town. Firms are just waiting for the other shoe to drop.” Interviews with nearly a dozen lawyers and legal industry professionals shed light on the quiet fear gripping many law firms with decades of history doing business in Washington. A number of major firms are strategizing behind the scenes on how to react without attracting attention in wider political conversations, according to several people in Washington’s legal community. Firm leaders, sources tell CNN, want to quell fears among their lawyers, especially younger associates who may be more likely to want the firms to take a stand politically against Trump. So far, Trump’s executive orders have targeted four large law firms –Perkins Coie;Jenner & Block;Covington & Burling; andPaul, Weiss, Wharton, Rifkin & Garrison. Among other things, lawyers at those firms have had their national security clearances suspended – a core piece of some legal defense work. Several lawyers who spoke to CNN expressed disappointment with the general lack of response from the legal industry and in Paul Weiss’ situation, thecapitulationto Trump’s targeting with the firm leader’s choice to cut a deal. Trump suggested Wednesday that universities and law firms are “bending” to his administration’s will as he’s targeted top legal firms that have represented his perceived political enemies. “You see what we’re doing with the colleges, and they’re all bending and saying, ‘Sir, thank you very much. We appreciate it,’” Trump said at a White House event marking Women’s History Month. “Nobody can believe it, including law firms that have been so horrible, law firms that, nobody would believe this, just saying, ‘Where do I sign? Where do I sign?’ … And there’s more coming, but we really are in the ‘Golden age of America.’” Rather than fight an executive order, the New York dealmaking powerhouse law firm Paul Weiss agreed to provide $40 million in legal work to causes backed by the White House, including veterans’ assistance and countering antisemitism, according to an email chairman Brad Karp sent firmwide on Sunday that was obtained by CNN. Several lawyers in Washington privately griped about Karp backing down from a fight against Trump. Several dozen alumni of Paul Weiss this weekalso published anopen letter “to protest the firm’s recent decision to surrender to the Trump administration,” the letter said. But some legal industry insiders weren’t surprised nor were they outraged by Paul Weiss’ move. It’s not unusual for lawyers to “look at all of your options,” Cari Brunelle, a legal industry consultant, told CNN. “Sometimes you choose to litigate, and sometimes you choose to settle. It’s what you do for your clients every day.” For instance, an amicus brief being drafted in support of Perkins Coie has gotten few signatures from leaders at other firms, several people familiar with it say. The White House is drafting more executive orders that would target more firms, according to two people familiar with what is in the works. At the same time, the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commissionhas sent lettersto another handful of law firms announcing a “review” of their diversity, equity and inclusion practices. Retaliation for DEI initiatives has been part of the White House executive orders against law firms, making those firms contacted by the EEOC especially concerned. If law firms don’t stand together, the president would be able to “wipe out any potential legal opposition,” Elliot Peters of the West Coast-centric litigation firm Keker, Van Nest & Peters. Peters said he believed Trump’s actions so far add to a reality where Congress no longer pushes back against the president, and as Trump also tries to silence the press. “We’re well on our road to an authoritarian government here,” he said. Keker has been one of the few major US law firms willing to make a public statement criticizing the executive orders against law firms. Though a number of firms are potentially at risk, the situation is particularly dire for Perkins Coie, according to a number of people familiar with the matter, who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity. The White House announced it was blacklisting a number of its lawyers from federal buildings and potentially punishing its clients if they contract with the government, sending an immediate chill across the firm’s everyday operations, sources said and according to a court case the firm has brought against the administration. Agencies have pulled back from working with the law firm, and one recent meeting was canceled for the firm at the Justice Department related to an ongoing client matter, sources and the firm’s lawyer have said. Dane Butswinkas, an attorney representing Perkins Coie in its challenge to the executive order, told a judge recently that the White House’s approach would “spell the end of the law firm.” District Judge Beryl Howell this monthorderedthe administration to stop many of the ways agencies could restrict Perkins Coie lawyers, deeming much of that executive order unconstitutional. The American Bar Association along with dozens of other voluntary lawyer groups across the country have pushed back against the reticence across the profession to speak out. “We will not stay silent in the face of efforts to remake the legal profession into something that rewards those who agree with the government and punishes those who do not,” a statement on Wednesday said. “We call upon the entire profession, including lawyers in private practice from Main Street to Wall Street, as well as those in corporations and who serve in elected positions, to speak out against intimidation.” Related articleIt’s still Antonin Scalia’s Supreme Court Even so, the White House continued its campaign against law firms on Tuesday, announcing more restrictions. Jenner & Blockwas targeted with another executive orderpartly because one of its former well-known partners, Andrew Weissmann, had been a top prosecutor on the Russia investigation around Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, according to the White House. Jenner & Block is also working on several lawsuits challenging Trump’s policies. A Jenner & Block spokesman, in a statement, acknowledged the firm had been named in Tuesday’s executive order but didn’t indicate how the firm would respond. “We remain focused on serving and safeguarding our clients’ interests with the dedication, integrity, and expertise that has defined our firm for more than one hundred years and will pursue all appropriate remedies,” the statement said.

CNN,Corporate interests pay for luxury foreign trips. State attorneys general join for free," The guest list for the exclusive junket to South Africa in 2023 included lobbyists and lawyers for leading US companies such as Uber, Amazon and Pfizer. The trip featured a safari, a stay at a five-star hotel that promises guests “a sophisticated world of luxury,” as well as wine tours and gourmet dinners at restaurants that serve fresh prawns and Wagyu ribeye steak. But well-heeled corporate players weren’t the only guests who accepted invitations to the costly excursion: So, too, did a bipartisan group of about a dozen attorneys general from across the country whose offices play a pivotal role in protecting consumers by enforcing the law against powerful interests. And while the major companies gave hefty donations to the group that organized the trip, the attorneys general joined for free. The list of invitees was not meant to be widely shared, according to a text message sent from a staff member of the event organizer to an aide of one of the attorneys general. “So just keep internal,” the staffer wrote of the list, which included attorneys general for Georgia, Illinois, Nevada, Minnesota and other states. The trip to South Africa, arranged and funded by the nonprofit Attorney General Alliance, is just one example of how corporate lawyers and lobbyists have paid to enjoy special access to state attorneys general through privately organized trips to US resorts and foreign destinations, according to records obtained by CNN related to events hosted by AGA. The group organizes multiple events each year, including an Italy trip scheduled next month. AGA said in statements that its foreign delegations have helped officials forge bipartisan and public-private relationships and facilitated talks on global issues such as human, drug and animal trafficking, money laundering and other types of organized crime. The group also said that activities like the wildlife and winery tours involved education about agriculture and environmental threats. But by attending these private events with corporate representatives, critics say, attorneys general can erode public trust in their actions related to the sponsoring companies. “It’s a whole game of getting the public officials together with the corporate people who in effect lobby to get what they want,” said Richard Painter, a former White House ethics lawyer under President George W. Bush turned law professor at the University of Minnesota. “Public trust is destroyed by this kind of thing.” AGA and its supporters reject such arguments. “I don’t see it as pay for play. I see it as an opportunity for a bipartisan conversation to make America better,” said Jon Bruning, a former Nebraska attorney general who attended the South Africa trip on behalf of his private law group. AGA, which pulled in nearly $27 million in sponsorships between 2019 and 2023, largely relies on donations from companies to fund its trips, according to financial documents from the group. Attorneys general also pay thousands of dollars per year in membership dues using taxpayer funds. The group has previously granted varying levels of perks to companies based on how much they have contributed, records show. An AGA document from 2023, for example, promised sponsors who contributed $100,000 access to “invite-only events” and speaking slots at conferences not available to donors who gave $30,000. The document listed dozens of donors from industries including health care, technology, energy and finance. Some of AGA’s sponsors have publicly acknowledged the benefit of attending the gatherings. The law firm Troutman Pepper Locke, listed as a participant in the South Africa trip and other AGA gatherings, notes on itswebsitethat the events are a “valuable forum for communicating directly with attorneys general about specific client concerns,” among other matters. The law firm, as well as other AGA corporate sponsors, have also attended events hosted by the Republican Attorneys General Association (RAGA) and the Democratic Attorneys General Association (DAGA). Some attorneys general who attended in South Africa say such trips are vital to learning about issues that affect their states. “I understand how this game is played… ‘Oh you went on a trip,’” said Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, a Democrat, referring to what he described as the practice of reporters trying to “embarrass” politicians. “I understand that thing, but I will say that there is real work that we are doing that is important for our constituents and has a lot to do with the fact that we live in a globalized world.” AGA formed in 2019 out of a decades-old organization that had promoted collaboration among attorneys general in western states, and has since organized meetings in US cities and foreign countries including Mexico, Israel, Morocco and France. Documents show the group has long given benefits to companies that help fund the junkets. Based on the sponsorship tier, AGA has previously permitted companies to provide suggestions for speakers, panelists, working groups, white papers and events, records show. For attorneys general attending the trips, AGA has offered to cover expenses. The group sent an email on July 15, 2022, for example, outlining an upcoming trip to Spain that included meetings with government officials along with “AGA private sector partners” and noted that “all” expenses for attorneys general would be covered. The email suggested the trip would also include tours of the Royal Palace of Madrid, the Prado art museum and ancient Roman ruins in Barcelona. “Count me in!” responded Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul, a Democrat, records show. In a statement, Raoul said AGA has provided invaluable training opportunities and added that collaborations facilitated by the group lead to “more effective enforcement efforts and better public policy that improves our residents’ quality of life.” An AGA email the following year promoted the South Africa trip as an educational experience that would feature discussion of topics like cybersecurity and environmental law. Text messages from AGA staffers also show them planning outings around the itinerary of expert speakers, including an hours-long wildlife excursion. “Immediately after you get off the bus, we will take you to lunch, there is alcohol, etc,” one AGA staffer messaged an attorney general during the late 2023 trip. Later, an AGA staffer shared photos and videos of the highlights: A lion prowling, a giraffe wandering the veldt, and antelopes and zebras in the wild. In a separate text exchange from 2023, a staff member for Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr asked an AGA staffer whether the group covered hotel incidentals. “Like a spa treatment or like food/snacks?” the AGA staffer wrote back. The attorney general employee clarified he was only asking about food reimbursements. The AGA staffer responded, “Just hold receipts or put on room.” A spokesperson for Carr, a Republican, said such association events “are essential to staying ahead of emerging threats and advancing public safety.” The invitees to South Africa included attorneys for major companies, including Tony West, Uber’s chief legal officer and the brother-in-law of former Vice President Kamala Harris, as well as Michael Beckerman, a public policy chief for TikTok, and Tom Moriarty, general counsel for grocery chain Albertsons, among others. Uber, TikTok and Albertsons did not comment for this story. Some of AGA’s sponsors who received invitations to South Africa and other events have faced multi-state investigations from attorneys general. Amazon has ranked among AGA’s biggest sponsors, disclosing annual payments dating back to about 2018. At one point in 2021, AGA’s internal documents listed Amazon in its “Major Gifts Circle” tier, which required a $500,000 sponsorship. States have taken legal action against the company. In September 2023, for example, the Federal Trade Commission along with 17 statesfileda lawsuit that alleged Amazon uses “anticompetitive” strategies to maintain “monopoly power.” Amazon has rejected those allegations and argued in court filings that its “pro-competitive practices” benefit consumers. A trial date has been set for October 2026. Two months after the suit was filed, a senior member of Amazon’s public policy team was listed as an attendee of AGA’s delegation to South Africa. Texts suggest multiple attorneys general involved in the lawsuit also accepted invitations for the delegation. The following summer, Amazon sent some representatives to AGA’s annual meeting in Colorado Springs, records show. Amazon did not comment for this story. Pfizer has also been listed among AGA’s largest sponsors. Reports filed by Pfizer’s PAC list about $3 million in contributions to AGA between roughly 2013 to 2022. AGA documents have listed Pfizer as a “Legacy Patron” and part of its “Major Gifts Circle.” Various states havereachedsettlementswithPfizer over the last decade in lawsuits related to drug prices. AGA’s attendance lists and itineraries show Pfizer representatives at multiple events in recent years, including in South Africa. Pfizer did not respond to a request for comment. The documents related to AGA events were shared with CNN by the American Accountability Foundation, a conservative organization that obtained them through public records requests. AAF argues that the conferences allow corporations undue power to push liberal policies behind closed doors. CNN independently confirmed details in the records. The documents do not show whether any company representatives discussed active litigation or reached agreements with state officials on any of the trips. Attorneys general contacted by CNN largely declined to answer questions about specific matters discussed with business representatives at the meetings. Tania Maestas, the deputy director of AGA, said her group has nothing to do with litigation involving attorneys general and does not act at the direction of private companies. “It’s a little surprising that people find it odd that AGs meet with their constituents. This is something that is encouraged and that they should do. What we do is provide a forum to be able to do that,” Maestas said. “By being in the same room or the same location, that’s not influence. That is not an ability to change the way an AG is going to do something. … AGs are better than that.” Maestas also said AGA hosts extensive trainings in the US that offer legal education credits for attorneys, and added that many event speakers come from groups that have not donated to her organization. Asked about the wine tours and safari on the South Africa trip, Maestas said attendees interacted with agricultural communities “to better understand the cultural and economic significance of farming,” visited a game reserve and joined a discussion on “combating the illicit trade of endangered species.” At times, attorneys general have been criticized for not disclosing their travels to AGA events. A January report released by an auditor in Utahfoundthe state’s former Republican attorney general, Sean Reyes, had not been “reasonably transparent” and highlighted how he did not disclose AGA trips to England, Ohio, Ghana and Spain as well as a trip to DC through another group, the National Association of Attorneys General. Inpostson X, Reyes said auditors had access to millions of documents including his calendars and “affirmed that there was no misuse of taxpayer funds.” When AGA organized an international delegation to Normandy, France, last summer, emails show they offered each attorney general a $15,000 flight allowance and covered the cost of travel, meals and lodging, which involved another five-star hotel that touts having “crystal chandeliers, soaring views and flawless service” as well as a regular guestlist of “Hollywood stars and polo players.” The trip was described as a commemoration of the 80th anniversary of D-Day, though records show it was scheduled nearly two months after the June 6 anniversary of the Allied invasion. The Associated Press previouslyreportedthe trip. Dave Yost, the Republican attorney general of Ohio, attended the trip with his wife, booking business class seats and airport lounge access for over $12,000. Democratic Attorney General of Maryland Anthony Brown and his wife charged a similar amount on their flights to France, according to receipts for their tickets. A spokesperson for Brown said he was honored to co-lead the delegation to commemorate a pivotal moment in history. AGA documents described the trip as a chance to foster diplomatic ties and learn about human trafficking, antisemitism and other matters. An itinerary shows the multi-day trip included a few hours of business meetings in the mornings, followed by invitations to museums and other historic sites. Supporters of these trips like Brian Kane, executive director of the National Association of Attorneys General, which co-sponsored the France trip, argue building relationships with stakeholders helps attorneys general more effectively do their jobs. “There’s absolutely a time and place for those more formal meetings, but one of the things that I’ve learned in my experience is that for those more formal meetings to be more effective, you have to have informal meetings,” Kane said. “Being able to sit down with somebody and understand them as a fellow human being is critically important to being able to understand them within the business setting.” In all, about two dozen state attorneys general attended the France delegation, which overlapped with the 2024 Olympic Games in the country, documents show. Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford, a Democrat listed as part of the AGA delegation,postedphotos of himself and his family in Paris that same week visiting the house for Team USA Olympians. Ford’s office did not respond to a request for comment. Maestas of AGA told CNN her group did not spend money on the Olympics on that trip, which she said included a visit to a memorial honoring fallen World War II soldiers. “The delegation to the beaches of Normandy reaffirmed that attorneys general have a shared commitment to justice, peace, and the values that unite us,” she said. After the trip, records show Maestas thanked the attorneys general for attending what she called an “educational adventure” and invited them to join a future event at a resort on the Caribbean coast of Mexico as well as another trip to Rome, Italy scheduled next month. “Join us for an unforgettable experience,” she wrote."
