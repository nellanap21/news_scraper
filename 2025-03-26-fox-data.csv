Fox,Inside Mike Johnson's meeting with judiciary hawks over Trump court standoff Congressional Republicans are looking to go beyond their vote next week," Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., huddled privately with House Judiciary Committee members on Tuesday afternoon for what was described as a ""brainstorming"" session on how to take on ""activist judges"" blocking PresidentDonald Trump'sagenda. The House is scheduled to vote next week on a bill to limit U.S. district judges in ordering nationwide injunctions. But the consensus among Republicans on the committee is that the bill by Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., isa good start, but more reform would be needed. ""He came to offer his thoughts to the committee and [Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio], about… what's available to us related to the judges,"" Rep. Scott Fitzgerald, R-Wis., told Fox News Digital. ""So it was more like a brainstorming kind of thing. No decisions were made."" He said there was also ""general"" discussion about court funding – as senior Republicans publicly float the idea of using Congress' appropriations powers to rein in activist judges.    ,        'S  ? ""The purse strings related to the courts – how does that work, what do we have available to us, what don't we, if we want to have that impact,"" Fitzgerald said. ""But I mean, nobody spelled out ‘Here’s what we're going to do when it comes to funding.'"" The Wisconsin Republican said the idea of legislating in a fast-tracked appeals process was also floated during the meeting. It's an idea also backed by his fellow Judiciary member Rep. Kevin Kiley, R-Calif., who declined to share details of the meeting with Fox News Digital but said ""there's other solutions"" beyond next week's vote. ""I think that it's worth exploring some sort of expedited appeals process, right? So you can fast-track an appeal if there's an injunction issue, to the D.C. circuit and ultimately to the Supreme Court,"" Kiley said. ""I think that'd be another way to approach the problem."" ""But yeah, it's an unfortunate state of affairs when you have someone, whose decisions are very much subject to appeal and reversal, who can keep administration policy in stasis."" A source briefed on the discussion told Fox News Digital that Johnson also signaled to House Judiciary Republicans that he was in close contact with the White House on the  judiciary strategy. The source described part of the conversation as a bid to rally Republicans behind the No Rogue Rulings Act, which is expected to get a House-wide vote either Tuesday or Wednesday next week, as of now. Led by Issa, thelegislation would forcemost district court judges to narrow most orders to the most relevant scope, therefore blocking them from pausing Trump’s policies across the U.S. Fitzgerald said part of the discussion with Johnson also focused on legislation to limit the ability of progressive plaintiffs to so-called ""judge-shop."" It's a similar idea to an amendment by Rep. Derek Schmidt, R-Kan., a first-term Republican on the committee, that is already attached to Issa's bill. ""On the forum shopping issue, the amendment I've got on the Issa bill addresses that, and makes it more difficult to engage in judge shopping because it requires that any request for a nationwide injunction is properly brought,"" Schmidt told Fox News Digital. ""It would go to a three-judge panel that's randomly selected."" ' ':       -   The Kansas Republican suggested House Judiciary members were interested in looking at what could be long-lasting reform.         ""I do think there are other opportunities. And one of the things I think is very important is that – not just on this issue, but more generally – we think…about how we can make long-term, lasting change that will outlast any of us who are serving in office right now and leave the system better than we found it,"" he said. Fox News Digital reached out to the speaker's office and the Judiciary Committee for comment but did not immediately hear back. Jordan is expected to hold a hearing on April 1 examining judicial activism."
Fox,Elon Musk tapped to help lead investigation into Signal chat leak: White House The White House has called The Atlantic's reports on the Signal chat leak a 'hoax'," Elon Musk is helping lead the investigation into the Signal chat leak involving top national security leaders and the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic,White House press secretaryKaronline Leavitt said Wednesday. ""The National Security Council, the White House Counsel's Office, and also, yes, Elon Musk's team"" will be leading the investigation into the Signal leak, Leavitt said during Wednesday's White House press conference. ""Elon Musk has offered to put his technical experts on this, to figure out how this number was inadvertently added to the chat — again, to take responsibility and ensure this can never happen again,"" she continued. The Trump administration is facing backlash from Democrats and other critics after The Atlantic's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, revealed in an article published Monday that he was added to a Signal group chat with topnational security leaders, including national security advisor Mike Waltz, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and  Director John Ratcliffe.               Signal is an encrypted messaging app that operates similarly to texting or making phone calls, but with additional security measures that help ensure communications are kept private to those included in the correspondence. The Atlantic's initial report characterized the Trump administration as texting ""war plans"" to one another. The Trump administration has maintained that no classified material was transmitted in the chat, with PresidentDonald Trumpdefending Waltz amid the fallout. Trump revealed Tuesday that a member of Waltz's office invited Goldberg to the chat, but did not provide additional information.     'S   A ''    ' '  Waltz joined Fox News' ""The Ingraham Angle"" on Tuesday, where he took responsibility for the inadvertent addition of Goldberg to the chat, arguing he believed the account belonged to someone else. ""I built the group. My job is to make sure everything’s coordinated,"" Waltz said. ""Of course I didn’t see this loser in the group. It looked like someone else,"" Waltz added. ""The person I thought was on there was never on there."" Waltz also said during the interview that he had just spoken to Musk about the matter and that the ""best technical minds"" would look into it. Musk is helping lead the Department of Government Efficiency, which has been poring through federal agencies in search of government overspending, fraud and mismanagement. ""If this story proves anything, it proves that Democrats and their propagandists in the mainstream media know how to fabricate, orchestrate and disseminate a misinformation campaign quite well,"" Leavitt continued. ""And there's arguably no one in the media who loves manufacturing and pushing hoaxes more than Jeffrey Goldberg.""              Following Monday's report in The Atlantic concerning the Signal chat, Goldberg published a Wednesday follow-up story that included messages directly from the chat. The article notably did not characterize the correspondence as ""war plans,"" instead opting to refer to them as ""attack plans"" in the headline. The Trump administration responded that the follow-up story proved that there were ""no war plans"" in the correspondence, taking a victory lap that the story was exposed to be a ""hoax."" ""The Atlantic has conceded: these were  'war plans,'"" Leavitt posted to X on Wednesday morning. ""This entire story was another hoax written by a Trump-hater who is well-known for his sensationalist spin.""    'S      Waltz posted to X on Wednesday, ""No locations. No sources & methods.   . Foreign partners had already been notified that strikes were imminent.  : President Trump is protecting America and our interests."" A spokesperson for The Atlantic defended that the outlet did expose a ""war plan"" in its Wednesday report, pointing Fox News Digital to a screenshot included in the piece ofHegseth's messagesrelated to F-18s and drone strikes that were accompanied by timestamps for the operation.         ""If this information — particularly the exact times American aircraft were taking off for Yemen — had fallen into the wrong hands in that crucial two-hour period, American pilots and other American personnel could have been exposed to even greater danger than they ordinarily would face,"" the report stated. Leavitt said during the press conference that Signal is an ""approved app"" for government employees, citing that the "" has it loaded onto government phones because it is the most secure and efficient way to communicate."""

Fox,Federal judge denies Trump admin's effort to ban transgender people from military US District Judge Ana Reyes denied the DOD's motion to dismiss her order," A federal judge denied PresidentDonald Trump’sadministration’s efforts to ban transgender people from joining the military, which was set to go into effect Friday. The Department of Justice has since filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia. Washington, D.C.-based U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes,a Biden appointee, on Wednesday, denied the government’s motion to dissolve her order that prevents the military from denying transgender people the ability to enlist in the military. Reyes presided over a hearing on March 21, when she requested the Department of Defense () delay its original March 26 deadline to enact the policy.            On March 21, the defendants in the suit, who include Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, filed a motion to dissolve the injunction blocking the Pentagon's ban. The filing argued that the policy is not an overarching ban but instead ""turns on gender dysphoria – a medical condition – and does not discriminate against trans-identifying persons as a class."" The Trump administration further requested that, if the motion to dissolve is denied, the court should stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal. The government cited new guidance issued March 21 that it expected to enact the policy if not for the ongoing litigation. The guidance clarified that ""the phrase ‘exhibit symptoms consistent with gender dysphoria’"" solely applies to ""'individuals who exhibit such symptoms as would be sufficient to constitute a diagnosis.'"" Reyes said she wanted to allow more time for the appeals process. She also said she had previously allowed plenty of time to appeal her earlier opinion blocking the ban from going into effect.                On Wednesday, Reyes acknowledged thatMilitary DepartmentIdentification Guidance ( Guidance) is new, but the argument presented by the defense is not. ""Defendants re-emphasize their ‘consistent position that the [Hegseth] Policy is concerned with the military readiness, deployability, and costs associated with a medical condition,’"" the judge wrote. ""Regulating gender dysphoria is no different than regulating bipolar disorder, eating disorders, or suicidality. The Military Ban regulates a medical condition, they insist, not people. And therein lies the problem.             ""Gender dysphoria is not like other medical conditions, something Defendants well know,"" Reyes continued. ""It affects only one group of people: all persons with gender dysphoria are transgender and only transgender persons experience gender dysphoria."" She later noted that the opinion has generated a heated public debate, and, as the court predicted, the Trump administration will appeal. ""This is all to the good,"" Reyes said. ""But let's recall that our service members make the debate and appeals possible. Their sacrifices breathe life into the phrase, ‘one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.’ The Court, again, thanks them all.""        The legal challenge comes as the Supreme Court also considers a high-profile case dealing with transgender rights. The issue in the case, United States vs. Skrmetti, is whether the equal protection clause, which requires the government to treat similarly situated people the same, prohibits states from allowingmedical providersto deliver puberty blockers and hormones to assist with a minor's transition to another sex.

Fox,Congressional Democrats find their voice as Signal slip-up becomes talk of the town Trump administration's reeling opposition may have just found solid footing," It was sheer coincidence that two of the witnesses testifying before a rare, public hearing of theSenate Intelligence CommitteeTuesday were part of the botched text chain about military action in Yemen. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and  Director John Ratcliffe were scheduled for the committee’s annual ""worldwide threats"" hearing. But something else commandeered the talk of the town. Had the text chain not dropped, there would have been lengthy discussions about domestic terrorism and the threat at the border. How the U.S. was grappling with China. Was there progress in theMiddle East? How about the war in Ukraine?       : '  A  '  Director Kash Patel joined Gabbard and Ratcliffe at the witness table. Patel just assembled a task force to address domestic terrorism. Under other circumstances, senators may have questioned Patel about people setting Teslas afire and keying Cybertrucks. But that was not to be. Democrats have reeled since the early days of the second Trump Administration. They’ve failed to establish their footing. They’ve attacked one another after Senate Minority LeaderChuck Schumer, D-N.Y., sided with Republicans to help avoid a government shutdown. Other Democrats faced irate voters, infuriated that the people they elected aren’t doing more to stand up to President Trump and Congressional Republicans. And then Democrats scored a gift with the bolloxed text chain. Or, it was at least something Democrats could wield against the other side. They were apoplectic about the group chat. ""It’s the dumbest thing I've seen,"" saidSen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz. ""I think this is one more example of the kind of sloppy, careless, incompetent behavior,"" bemoaned Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee.           : ''S   ' Democrats charged that intelligence officials were cavalier with information. ""This sloppiness, this incompetence, this disrespect for our intelligence agencies and the personnel who work for them is entirely unacceptable. It's an embarrassment,"" said Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo. ""You need to do better. You need to do better."" Gabbard initially sidestepped when Warner questioned her about the digital misfire. ""Senator, I don't want to get into the specifics,"" Gabbard said. That response confounded Warner. ""You're not going to be willing to address…?"" said Warner. ""Are you denying that? Will you answer my question, ma'am?"" But Gabbard deliberately addressed the group chat controversy when she testified Wednesday before the House Intelligence Committee. She did so in her opening remarks. But after she addressed cybersecurity threatsfrom Chinaand volatility in the Middle East. Gabbard said that it was a ""mistake"" to include Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg on the text chain. ""The national security adviser has taken full responsibility for this. And the National Security Council is conducting an in-depth review, along with technical experts working to determine how this reporter was inadvertently added to this chat,"" said Gabbard. ""No classified information was shared. There were no sources, methods, locations, or war plans that were shared.""           :   Gabbard then informed the committee that because of a lawsuit filed about the text chain she was ""limited in my ability to comment further on that specific case."" The  and other intelligence services sometimes rely on the encrypted chat app Signal for coordination. ""The use of Signal message and end encryption applications is permissible and was in this case, ‘use permissible,’"" said Ratcliffe at the Senate hearing. Gabbard said the bungled texts divulged no top secrets. ""There was no classified material that was shared in that,"" said Gabbard. ""So then if there (is) no classified material, share it with the committee. You can't have it both ways,"" countered Warner. Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., who sits on the Intelligence Committee and is the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, chimed in at a news conference. ""If that's true, the administration should immediately provide a copy of the group chat to Congress,"" said Reed. The debate over operational security and faulty handling of sensitive information is the entrée for this story. But frank assessments about Europe and U.S. allies by Vice PresidentJD Vanceand Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth constituted a fascinating group chat biproduct. 'S :      Vance texted his concerns about the U.S. commencing airstrikes – which may be more beneficial for Europe than the United States. Vance and other Trump Administration officials have criticized Europe for their approaches to security – often leaning on the United States. ""3 percent of  trade runs through the suez,"" texted Vance, addressing how the Houthis pose a risk to shipping through the Suez Canal. ""40 percent of European trade does."" Vance blessed the operation on the text chain. But added this jab. ""I just hate bailing Europe out again,"" texted the Vice President. Then Hegseth jumped in. ""I fully share your loathing of European free-loading,"" replied Hegseth. ""It's ."" ""Doesn't that harm our relationship with them?"" yours truly asked Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D. ""I think you have to put that into context for what it is,"" replied Thune. ""This is a new administration. There's a new sheriff in town. And, at some point, I thinkthe Europeansand all the other countries around the world - whether they like it or not - realize that."" Some Republicans tried to give the national security officials a pass. ""If you have never made a mistake, then you can throw the first stone,"" said Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, R-Fla.           Other Republicans shot the messenger. ""What The Atlantic did by making public something that they believed could have been national security sensitive is irresponsible activity (by) the press,"" said Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif. But deserved or not, consider how much time lawmakers from both sides burned on the chat group snafu versus delving into actual global threats at the hearings. After all, that was the expected subject of the sessions. There are consequences for that. ""The penalty is we’re less prepared to deal with the dangerous world,"" said Sen. John Kennedy, R-La. ""We're not as far as long as we should be and having a very serious discussion about national security."" House Intelligence Committee member and Rep. Chrissy Houlahan, D-Penn., said it was her ""intent to talk about biosecurity and bioterrorism"" at the hearing. But she couldn’t because of the text chat. ""It does distract from the conversation. And I'm frustrated by unforced errors that we don't have to be dealing with,"" said Houlahan.        '    ' But despite what played out in public, both theHouse and SenateIntelligence Committees conducted private, frank sessions with officials after the open forums. ""We covered a lot of things in that closed session,"" said Rep. Jim Himes, D-Ct., the top Democrat on the Intelligence panel. ""Everything from Russia to China to fentanyl. You name it."" But Himes lamented that the committees exhausted so much time discussing the text chain.         The group chat story is here to stay. At least for a while. Until another major story barrels its way onto the scene and rattles everything on Capitol Hill. At that point the new subject becomes the talk of the town."

Two Tesla humanoid robots were at the event, with onlookers crowding the machines as they struck various poses. They waved their arms at times, and held up hands with two fingers aloft on each in a Richard Nixon-like pose. At one point, a robot's arm swung out and hit the rope dividing it from the crowd, briefly sending a security guard scrambling to fix it. Outside of Washington, however, Tesla car dealerships have been targeted by progressive activists across the country.

""The competition is with China, and we are united in winning that competition,"" Moolenaar told Fox News Digital at the event. He called Telsa ""innovative,"" adding, ""All the companies here have shown tremendous ingenuity, and we were pleased to highlight all of their efforts."" The event featured bots from other events, including so-called ""robot dogs,"" officially known as ""Spot the Agile Mobile Robot"" by Boston Dynamics, and a similar machine by Ghost Robotics. Moolenaar said Spot stood out to him in particular, as well as Tesla's two robot humanoids that were present at the event. ""It's amazing technology, and what struck me was a lot of the same technology that's in a vehicle is used in these humanoid robots,"" he said. Rep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla., another member of the committee, said the Tesla robots could have ""unbelievable applications."" ""Maybe in agriculture — a lot of our farmers are going out of business, can't compete labor-wise, right?

Fox,Top agency staffer trying to block crucial Trump directive once managed DEI team Republicans blasted the agency's decision by a 'far-left radical whose main job is pushing DEI nonsense'," :Republicans on Capitol Hill are fuming that the Government Accountability Office () general counsel who shut downPresident Donald Trump's request to supersede California's aggressive gas emissions laws once managed diversity, equity and inclusion () initiatives for the agency. Republicans have dismissed the decision penned by  General Counsel Edda Emmanuelli Perez, because she once served as the agency's ""Managing Director of Opportunity and Inclusiveness (O&I)."" According to theGAO's official website, the O&I office includes advising senior staff on equal employment opportunities and promoting a ""work environment that is fair, unbiased and inclusive."" ""A far-left radical whose main job is pushing  nonsense is trying to undermine American prosperity. What a surprise. These bad actors should be removed from government swiftly,"" Sen.

Fox,CIA director blasts Democrat's 'offensive line of questioning' about Hegseth's 'drinking habits' Rep. Jimmy Gomez asks if Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth was drinking during Signal group chat exchange,"  Director John Ratcliffe blasted a California Democrat Wednesday for asking him ""whetherSecretary of Defense Pete Hegsethhad been drinking before he leaked classified information"" in a Signal chat group, calling his words an ""offensive line of questioning."" Rep. Jimmy Gomez sparked the testy exchange during a House Intelligence Committee hearing on worldwide threats, where Ratcliffe appeared alongside Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and other top Trump administration officials. ""The main person who was involved in this thread that a lot of people want to talk to is, Secretary of Defense Hegseth. And a lot of questions were brought up regarding his drinking habits in hisconfirmation hearing.To your knowledge, do you know whether Pete Hegseth had been drinking before he leaked classified information?"" Gomez asked Gabbard, to which she responded, ""I don't have any knowledge of Secretary Hegseth’s personal habits."" When Gomez then asked Ratcliffe the same question, telling him it was either a ""yes or no"" answer, Ratcliffe fired back, saying ""You know, no. I'm going to answer that. I think that's an offensive line of questioning.""           ""The answer is no. I find it interesting..."" Ratcliffe continued before Gomez began shouting ""Hey, I yield back, this is my time, director! Director!"" ""You asked me a question, do you want an answer?"" Ratcliffe said. ""You don't want to focus on the good work thatthe  doing, that the intelligence community..."" ""Director, I reclaim my time. Director, I reclaim my time,"" Gomez then said. ""I have huge respect for the , huge respect for men and women in uniform. But this was a question that's on the top of the minds of every American, right?"" ""He stood in front of a podium in Europe holding a drink,"" Gomez then claimed. ""Was his performance compromised because of a successful strike?... you think he should accept responsibility for a successful strike to make Americans safer?"" Ratcliffe started saying as Gomez again interrupted him in an attempt to get the situation under control.        ‘    ’ Rep. Ben Cline, R-Va., followed Gomez’s questioning and allowed Ratcliffe to speak without interruption. ""I appreciate that, Congressman. I guess, you know, just a general reflection here again, that, for the last two days, members of the intelligence community have been asking questions about a Signal messaging group and not asking questions -- from Democrats either in the Senate or the House -- on China, Russia, Iran and the real threats, that are going on the United States,"" the  director said.         ""No one's asked me about my second day on the job here, where I lit the fuse that led to a foreign government participating with us to capture one of the senior planners of the Abbey gate bombing that killed 13 Americans,"" he added, ""But instead, we're getting questions about whether or not someone has drinking habits."""
Fox,How Mike Johnson and Jim Jordan could hit back at judges blocking Trump's agenda Republicans could take on 'activist judges' via funding and reform," Congressional Republicans are looking at a variety of options to stand up against what they see as ""activist judges"" blocking PresidentDonald Trump’sagenda. Many of those options will likely be discussed at the House Judiciary's hearing on the matter next week, which sources expect to be scheduled for April 1. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., huddled privately with Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee Tuesday afternoon to coalesce lawmakers around a bill up for a vote next week that would limit federal district court judges’ ability to issue nationwide injunctions. One source familiar with discussions told Fox News Digital that Johnson suggested Republicans could look at other options as well, something conservatives are looking for. House Freedom Caucus member Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., told Fox News Digital that the legislation was a ""good start.""    ,        'S  ? The No Rogue Rulings Act has support fromboth the White Houseand House  leadership. It’s expected to get a House-wide vote Tuesday or Wednesday of next week. Led by Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., the legislation would force most district court judges to narrow most orders to the most relevant scope, therefore blocking them from pausing Trump’s policies across the U.S. No Republican lawmaker has publicly expressed doubts about the bill, but conservatives have warned they want to see more from Congress on activist judges. Both Johnson and top members of the House Judiciary Committee have floated using Congress’ power of the purse to rein in activist courts. ""We do have authority over the federal courts,"" Johnson said at his weekly press conference. ""We do have power over funding, over the courts, and all these other things. But desperate times call for desperate measures, and Congress is going to act."" But Congress controls government spending through several different mechanisms. Lawmakers have the power to set annual appropriations levels, to rescind that funding via a rescission package, and even leverage funding outside of Congress' yearly appropriations via thebudget reconciliation process. ""I think we need to look at… funding scenarios. Now, that takes a little time; you've got to work through either the appropriations, rescissions or reconciliation process, depending on where it's appropriate,"" Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, chair of the House Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on the Constitution, told Fox News Digital last week – while stressing he was not ""for or against"" any specific scenario. Several Republicans have introduced resolutions to impeach various federal judges for blocking Trump's agenda, but there appears to be little appetite within the House  to pursue that lane. Johnson signaled he was against the move during a closed-door meeting with Republicans on Tuesday morning, noting just 15 federal judges have been impeached in U.S. history. ' ':       -   ""There was some innuendo there that, you know, impeachment has been reserved for judges with high crimes and misdemeanors,not because youdisagree with his decisions,"" one House Republican said of Johnson's message.         Conservatives could attempt to force House  leaders to act by classifying their impeachment legislation as a ""privileged resolution,"" meaning the House must hold at least a chamber-wide procedural vote on the measure within two legislative days. But it's not clear that will be pursued, either. Two Republicans who filed such resolutions – Reps. Brandon Gill, R-Texas, and Derrick Van Orden, R-Wis. – said they did not have current plans to make their resolutions privileged. It's not a totally dismissed option, however, as leaders, including House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, continue to insist nothing is off the table."

""The Atlantic has conceded: these were  'war plans,'"" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt posted to X Wednesday morning. ""This entire story was another hoax written by a Trump-hater who is well-known for his sensationalist spin."" National security advisor Mike Waltz posted to X Wednesday, ""No locations. No sources & methods.   . Foreign partners had already been notified that strikes were imminent.  : President Trump is protecting America and our interests.""              The Trump administration came under fire from Democrats and other critics Monday after the Atlantic magazine published an article revealing that top national security officials discussed a planned strike in Yemen against terrorist forces in a Signal group chat that also included the editor-in-chief of the Atlantic. The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg published a firsthand account Monday of what he read in the Signal group chat, called ""Houthi  Small Group,"" after he was added to the chain March 13 alongside high-ranking federal officials stretching from Secretary of DefensePete Hegsethto Waltz and Trump chief of staff Susie Wiles. Monday's article was headlined: ""The Trump Administration Accidentally Texted Me Its War Plans."" Trump administration officialshave repeatedly argued since the release of the article that no classified information was included in the Signal correspondence. On Wednesday morning, the Atlantic published a follow-up story that included direct texts from the Signal chat, but notably did not include the phrase ""war plans"" in its headline, instead characterizing the texts as ""attack plans."" The phrase ""war plans"" was included in the Wednesday piece as quotes attributable to the administration pouring cold water that they shared classified information in the chat.    ’S     : 'I    I'M ' A spokesperson for the Atlantic defended that the outlet did expose a ""war plan"" in its Wednesday report, pointing Fox News Digital to a screenshot included in the piece of Hegseth's messages related to F-18s and drone strikes that were accompanied by timestamps for the operation. ""If this information – particularly the exact times American aircraft were taking off for Yemen – had fallen into the wrong hands in that crucial two-hour period, American pilots and other American personnel could have been exposed to even greater danger than they ordinarily would face,"" the report stated. The Department of Defense does not specifically define what constitutes a ""war plan,"" according to the U.S. Army War College, though war plans are understood as in-depth plans for an ""overarching strategy."" ""If we consider war to be apolitical act betweentwo or more states, nations, or other polities, a war plan must consider the totality of those polities’ potential political objectives, industrial capabilities, and military options for the expected duration of the conflict,"" the Army War College posted in 2020 in an explainer article headlined, ""What's in a War Plan?"" ""A war plan develops a concept to win a war militarily and politically; it is the detailed ways and means of an overarching strategy. A review of two historical examples of such planning offer approaches to overcome organizational and institutional obstacles to effective comprehensive war planning."" Officials with the Trump administration continued on X that the Atlantic's report was a ""hoax"" for initially describing the chat as containing ""war plans."" ""So, let’s me get this straight. The Atlantic released the so-called ‘war plans’ and those ‘plans’ include: No names. No targets. No locations. No units. No routes. No sources. No methods. And no classified information. Those are some really s----- war plans. This only proves one thing: Jeff Goldberg has never seen a war plan or an ‘attack plan’ (as he now calls it). Not even close. As I type this, my team and I are traveling the  region, meeting w/ Commanders (the guys who make  ‘war plans’) and talking to troops. We will continue to do our job, while the media does what it does best: peddle hoaxes,"" Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth posted to his personal X account Wednesday. A Department of Defense memo from 2023 under the Biden administration detailed that while Signal was approved for some use by government officials, the platform could not be used to ""access, transmit, process non-public DoD information."" TheCybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency(), the federal office in charge of ensuring cybersecurity at all levels of the government, published a ""best practice"" for ""highly targeted"" government officials in December 2024 advising ""highly targeted"" government officials to use Signal as an extra precaution against potential hackers. 's ""Mobile Communications Best Practice Guidance"" defined as highly targeted individuals as high-ranking governmentofficials or politicianswho are ""likely to possess information of interest to these threat actors."" The document specifically addressed high-targeted politicos and officials, though it noted the guide was ""applicable to all audiences."" ""Adopt a free messaging application for secure communications that guarantees end-to-end encryption, such as Signal or similar apps,"" the guidance states. "" recommends an end-to-end encrypted messaging app that is compatible with both iPhone and Android operating systems, allowing for text message interoperability across platforms. Such apps may also offer clients for MacOS, Windows, and Linux, and sometimes the web. These apps typically support one-on-one text chats, group chats with up to 1,000 participants, and encrypted voice and video calls. Additionally, they may include features like disappearing messages and images, which can enhance privacy."" Signal's popularity grew in the past few months, after it was discovered that Chinese-linked hackers were targeting cellphone data in the U.S., including data belonging to PresidentDonald Trumpand Vice President  Vance during the campaign, Politico reported Tuesday.

""Those messages were revealed today and revealed that I did not transmit classified information, and that the reporter who I don't know, I think intentionally intended it to indicate that,"" Ratcliffe continued. ""That reporter also indicated that I had released the name of an undercover  operative in that Signal chat. In fact, I had released the name of my chief of staff who was not operating undercover. That was deliberately false and misleading."" ""I used an appropriate channel to communicate sensitive information. It was permissible to do so. I didn't transfer any classified information.

""So it's your testimony that less than two weeks ago, you were on a Signal chat that had all of this information about F-18s and -9 Reapers and targets on strike.

Ranking Member Jim Himes, D-Conn., asked her.  ’S         ""My testimony is I did not recall the exact details of what was included there,"" Gabbard said.

Fox,"How Donald Trump dominates the news, both positively and negatively AP is suing the Trump administration for banning its reporters from the White House pool"," The Associated Press, not exactly aWhite Housefavorite, has shot itself in the foot. The following retraction is nothing short of humiliating: ""The Associated Press has withdrawn its story about U.S. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard saying President Trump andRussian President Vladimir Putin‘are very good friends.’ Gabbard was talking about Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The  will publish a corrected version of the story.""      ‘’ ,      Whoa! How do you run that piece in the first place without having it nailed down? The wire service, you may recall, is suing theTrump administrationfor ousting its reporters from the White House pool over its refusal to refer to ""Gulf of America."" So, this unforced error puts the White House in I-told-you-so mode. On Monday, when Trump was at the Kennedy Center, an  reporter tried to ask a question, Trump asked, ""Who are you with?"" After the journalist identified himself, the president said: ""I don’t want to talk to  anymore. I think you’re so discredited."" The Trump team later posted the exchange with ""mic drop"" emojis. The point is that Trump dominates the news no matter what he does. And, as I’ve been saying for the 35 years I’ve known him, even a torrent of negative publicity helps him because his media detractors are playing on his turf. While Trump was visiting the Kennedy Center, he ""floated"" the idea of personally hosting the annual awards show. And who’s going to stop him, since he’s purged the Democratic board members?  ,  ,     ','  A -  The ratings, he said, would skyrocket. And he’s right about that. As the New York Times notes, a younger Trump dreamed of becoming a Broadway producer. He now says the Kennedy Center will concentrate on producing ""Broadway hits."" And by the way, Trump released 80,000 pages of  assassination files yesterday and has asked for no redactions. The president can make news on the slightest whim, just by posting on Truth Social. He just went after Judge James Boasberg, who ordered the deportations of mostly Venezuelan gang members to be stopped while planes were still in the air: ""This judge, like many of the Crooked Judges’ I am forced to appear before, should be !!!""  ’T  , ,   ,     ,   ."" The posting drew a rare rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts: ""For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision. The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.""  ,   ,       ’S   The president is also renewing his habit of goingafter journalistspersonally. Ashley Parker had a highly successful career at the New York Times and Washington Post–she’s also an  analyst–who recently joined the Atlantic. She asked Trump for an interview. After dismissing the liberal Atlantic as a ""Third Rate Magazine,"" Trump posted: ""Ashley Parker is not capable of doing a fair and unbiased interview. She is a Radical Left Lunatic, and has been as terrible as is possible for as long as I have known her. To this date, she doesn’t even know that I won the Presidency  times. If you have some other reporter, let us know, but Ashley is not capable or competent enough to understand the intricacies of High Level politics."" Parker is restrained, not radical, and in bringing up the 2020 election, Trump is asking her to accept something that has never been proven in court or by his own attorney general. A magazine spokesperson said, ""Atlantic reporters are diligent and fair and continue to pursue stories of importance to the public."" And then there is, you know, the actual job of the presidency. Trump reported yesterday on his 90-minute phone call with Vladimir Putin. They ""stressed the need for improved bilateral relations between theUnited Statesand Russia"" – no surprise there. ""The leaders agreed that the movement to peace will begin with an energy and infrastructure ceasefire, as well as technical negotiations on implementation of a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea, full ceasefire and permanent peace…. ""They further discussed the need to stop proliferation of strategic weapons and will engage with others to ensure the broadest possible application. The two leaders shared the view that Iran should never be in a position to destroy Israel."" And: ""The two leaders agreed that a future with an improved bilateral relationship between the United States and Russia has huge upside,"" including ""enormous economic deals and geopolitical stability.""         It seems to me that Trump got next to nothing. A 30-day pause in attacks on energy plants and infrastructure, that’s about it. Everything else is subject to negotiations, which gives the Kremlin more time to keep attacking Ukraine and lock in further territorial gains. A real cease-fire seems a long way off. But whether Trump is on the attack or being attacked, he is driving the news every day, even inserting himself into culture and sports topics. Keep that in mind when the ratings-driven president hosts the Kennedy Center honors."
Fox,"Trump accuses Big Media of ‘illegal’ reporting, virtually abolishes Voice of America Major outlets seemed unusually mum on the president's rhetoric-charged speech"," President Trumphas spent the last decade railing against fake news, a phrase that’s now deeply embedded in our culture. He has accused the media of being relentlessly biased against him – which is largely true – and called out journalists by name. He has sued such outlets as  News (which paid him $16 million),  and the Des Moines Register. He has charged that Politico received payments for negatively covering him – it turned out these were routine subscriptions, and for the New York Times as well – and then canceled many of the subscriptions.      -, ''-   But in a controversial speech at theJustice Department, Trump went further than ever before. He said the Times, the Washington Post and the major networks were engaged in ""illegal"" reporting. The president did not specify what was illegal about it. But perhaps there’s a short distance between Trump’s accusation and a future prosecution? The  speech drew heavy coverage.The Times saidhe ""veered from his prepared remarks to lash out at lawyers and former prosecutors by name in a venue dedicated to the impartial administration of justice. He also accused the department’s previous leadership of trying to destroy him and declared former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. the head of a ‘crime’ family."" The Postquoted Trumpas saying his enemies had ""launched one hoax and disinformation operation after another, broke the law on a colossal scale, persecuted my family, staff and supporters, raided my home, Mar-a-Lago, and did everything within their power to prevent me from becoming the President of the United States."" The paper added: ""It is rare for a president to visit the Justice Department — which has kept safeguards between the White House and the law enforcement agency in the post-Watergate era to ensure that politics don’t interfere with law enforcement investigations."" But here’s the fascinating part. The Times and the Post made no mention of Trump’s ""illegal"" reporting charge. Didn’t give it as much as a paragraph. Couldn’t squeeze it in (I say in jest, since space is unlimited in the digital age). I see two possible explanations for this. One is that they are so offended by the president’s accusation, which they view as false, that they don’t want to give it any oxygen and share it with readers. In other words, when the president is shooting arrows at you, it’s best to deflect them. The other is that they fear that there might be a prosecution down the road – given Trump’s history of civil lawsuits – and don’t want to cross him on this issue. In short, they are intimidated by the president. But here’s the thing: If two of the nation’s preeminent newspapers aren’t going to defend themselves on the charge of illegality, who is? How can they expect any backing when they won’t stand up for themselves, by censoring Trump’s remarks? Meanwhile, over the weekend, the president all but abolished the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe with an executive order aimed at its parent agency – whose special adviser is former Arizona candidateKari Lake. Trump ordered 1,300 journalists, executives and other staffers placed on indefinite leave. His argument is that they’re part of the radical left. He’s a longtime critic of , having once called it the ""voice of the Soviet Union.""   'S   , A    'S   Carla Babb, the ’s Pentagon correspondent, posted this: ""A silencing of  will be celebrated by communists, autocrats and ayatollahs whose lies we shed light on."" The  was launched during World War  and credited with successfully countering enemy propaganda for decades. But there’s a legitimate debate to been had about who the ""enemy"" is these days, given Trump’s friendly relationship withVladimir Putin. What’s more, people aren’t huddled around their radios as they were in 1942.         But those who were laid off indefinitely consider themselves independent journalists – and suddenly find themselves out of a job."
